<p>How you choose to include Origami components in your project will depend on your projectsâ€™ requirements:</p>

<h2 id="origami-build-service">Origami Build Service</h2>

<p>The Build service is best for quick projects or static sites or things where performance is less of a concern. This build method will fetch the Origami <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript as external files for your webpage. Be aware that this will indiscriminately fetch all stylistic variations of a component, which will increase your file size.</p>

<h2 id="package-manager-npm">Package Manager (npm)</h2>

<p>In order to customise your page and have more granular control over a components stylistic and behavioural features build Origami components manually. We currently do this by installing Origami components from the command line via the npm package manager. This process relies on a build step, which you may already have in your project.</p>
