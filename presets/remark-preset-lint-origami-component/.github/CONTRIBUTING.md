Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of

## Dependencies

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service.git
$ cd polyfill-service
$ npm ci
$ npm run build # build the assets for the website
$ npm start # start a server on localhost:8080
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

Please also provide a **test plan**, i.e. specify how you verified that your addition works.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](../LICENSE.md).

## Updating polyfill-library

1. Open a terminal to the root folder of the repository and ensure that the latest version of master is checked out. `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
2. Create a new branch to make changes into. `git checkout -b [name]`
3. In `package.json` rename the `polyfill-library` dependency to `polyfill-library-$version` and change the version to be an npm alias. E.G. `"polyfill-library": "^3.27.4"` becomes `"polyfill-library-3.27.4": "npm:polyfill-library@3.27.4"`
4. In `server/routes/v3/polyfill.js` add a new case statement for the version of `polyfill-library` you have just added.
5. In the terminal run `npm install polyfill-library@*`
6. In `fastly/vcl/main.vcl:114` add the new version to the if statement for setting the version query parameter.
7. Commit the file changes into git, push up the branch and open a pull-request

## Cutting a Release

Every merge to the master branch will trigger a release to [staging]. When ready to deploy to [production], follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal to the root folder of the repository and ensure that the latest version of master is checked out. `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
2. Create a new branch to make changes into. `git checkout -b [name]`
3. Follow the interactive release process. `npm version [major|minor|patch]`
4. Push the changes to GitHub and make a Pull-Request. `git push origin [name]`
5. Merge the Pull-Request. This triggers [circle-ci] to deploy the service and to publish the package to [npm].
6. Announce the release on the [@polyfillio] Twitter account.
