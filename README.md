## Usage

### Sass

As with all Origami components, o-normalise has a [silent mode](http://origami.ft.com/docs/syntax/scss/#silent-styles). To use its compiled CSS (rather than using its mixins with your own Sass) set `$o-normalise-is-silent : false;` in your Sass before you import the o-normalise Sass.

#### Available mixins

- `oNormaliseVisuallyHidden` - provides styles to [visually hide an element while remaining accessible to screen reader](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/hiding-content-for-accessibility).
- `oNormaliseClearfix` - adds clearfix styles to the element. See [this Sitepoint article for more on clearfixes - we use a variation on method 3.](https://www.sitepoint.com/clearing-floats-overview-different-clearfix-methods/)
- `oNormaliseBoxSizing` - adds `box-sizing: border-box` to the current and all descending elements, see [this article by Paul Irish for a full explanation](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/).

##### Normalising styles

The following mixins apply normalising styles to groups of HTML elements, these aim to fix browser inconsistencies and any potential side-effects caused by browser default styles.

- `oNormaliseHTML` - affects `html`, `body`, `main` elements and defaults `:focus` state
- `oNormaliseLinks` - affects `a` tags and `:hover` & `:active` states
- `oNormaliseText` - affects text related elements
- `oNormaliseImages` - affects the `img` element
- `oNormaliseForms` - affects form related elements

#### Available variables

- `$o-normalise-grid-gutters` - provides a map of standardised grid gutter sizes
- `$o-normalise-border-radius` - provides a standardised border radius value

### Focus States

`o-normalise` provides default focus states using the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class. This applies while an element matches the `:focus` pseudo-class and the UA determines that the focus should be specially indicated.

No browser supports `:focus-visible` right now (31st Jan 2018) but there is [a polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) which roughly mimics the behaviour by adding a class `.focus-visible` to an element if it should have `:focus-visible` applied to it. Integrate [the polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) with your project to apply these focus styles.

`:focus` is used as a fallback in `core` mode.
