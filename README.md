# Origami

Welcome to Origami!

This is the repository where we track issues and proposals and discussions
related to the Origami team, components, services and everything else.

## Proposal Backlog

The **[Proposal Backlog]** is where you can track and edit proposals. We recommend checking here first before proposing a new component.

### Propose a new Component

The **[Contributing Guide]** outlines how to create a new proposal, including how to propose a new component.

### Credit

A lot of credit for this proposal process goes to the GOV.UK design system community, who maintain [a similar backlog here](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog).
