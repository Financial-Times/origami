## Usage

### Markup

The basic markup structure for a teaser will look something like this:

```html
<div class="o-teaser o-teaser--small">
	<div class="o-teaser__content">
		<a href="#" class="o-teaser__tag">World</a>
		<h2 class="o-teaser__heading"><a href="#">Japan sells negative yield 10-year bonds</a></h2>
		<div class="o-teaser__timestamp">
			<time data-o-component="o-date" class="o-date" datetime="2016-02-29T12:35:48Z">2016-02-29T12:35:48Z</time>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

Teasers support a wide array of [elements](#supported-elements) and can be customised using several [themes](#themes) and should be used as required. For a full list of examples including example markup, see [o-teaser in the Registry](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-teaser).


#### Images

To add an image to a teaser, you should use the following markup structure:

```html
<div class="o-teaser__image-container">
	<img src="{image-src}" class="o-teaser__image" alt="{alt text}"/>
</div>
```

To support lazy-loading of images you can use the `o-teaser__image-placeholder` element, as below:

```html
<div class="o-teaser__image-container">
	<div class="o-teaser__image-placeholder">
		<img src="{image-src}" class="o-teaser__image" alt="{alt text}"/>
	</div>
</div>
```


#### Supported elements

The following elements are supported by default:

```css
.o-teaser__tag 						// Small coloured tag at the top of the teaser
.o-teaser__duration					// Duration of the content (for video content)
.o-teaser__heading 					// Main heading of the teaser
.o-teaser__standfirst 				// A short piece of content
.o-teaser__image-container			// Wrapper element for an image
.o-teaser__image       				// An image for the teaser
.o-teaser__headshot					// Author's headshot image
.o-teaser__timestamp 				// A styled timestamp for the teaser
.o-teaser__related 				 	// A list of related content links
.o-teaser__related-item 			// A single item of a related content list
```


### Sass:

As with all Origami components, o-teaser has a [silent mode](http://origami.ft.com/docs/syntax/scss/#silent-styles). To use its compiled CSS (rather than incorporating its mixins into your own Sass) set `$o-teaser-is-silent : false;` in your Sass before you import the o-teaser Sass:

```sass
$o-teaser-is-silent: false;
@import 'o-teaser/main';
```

#### Using Sass mixins

Teasers are made up of various elements (e.g. heading, standfirst, timestamp) and a series of themes (e.g. small, large, video). To get everything, use the `oTeaser()` mixin without arguments. To get only the stuff you need, you can pass in a list of elements and a list of themes:

```scss
oTeaser(('default', 'images'), ('small', 'large', 'video'));
```

The elements can be specified via groups:

- `default` - all basic text elements, including: heading, standfirst, meta, and tag.
- `images` - all image element styles
- `promoted` - promoted by and paid post element styles
- `related-items` - styling for the related items elements
- `timestamp` - styles for the timestamp and live post styles

[Themes](#themes) are configurable using the second argument of `oTeaser` and can be any combination of:

- `small` - styling for [small teasers](#small-teasers)
- `large` - styling for [large teasers](#large-teasers)
- `standard` - outputs the opinion and inverse themes
- `video` - outputs the [video teaser](#video-teasers) styles
- `top-stories` - outputs all top stories teaser styles and variations
- `hero` - outputs all [hero](#hero-teasers) teaser styles and variations


#### Themes

`o-teaser` has a selection of themes to help highlight content and provide a diverse layout. Themes are separated into 3 types of layout, each with their own modifiers to add different variations on the styles.

##### Small teasers

Uses the `o-teaser--small` modifier.

[View example on the Registry](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-teaser#demo-small)

Additional modifiers:

- `stacked`: moves the image to the top of the teaser
- `opinion`: changes the tag colour to blue
- `live`: change background to red and position of elements to make the teaser stand out

##### Large teasers

Uses the `o-teaser--large` modifier.

[View example on the Registry](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-teaser#demo-large)

Additional modifiers:

- `opinion`: adds a blue background
- `highlight`: adds a claret background

##### Hero teasers

Uses the `o-teaser--hero` modifier.

[View example on the Registry](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-teaser#demo-hero)

Additional modifiers:

- `centred`: centres the image and text
- `opinion`: adds a blue background
- `highlight`: adds a claret background
- `stretched`: makes the teaser take up the full height of the available space and anchors the standout and timestamp content to the bottom of the teaser.

##### Video teasers

Uses the `o-teaser--video` modifier.

[View example on the Registry](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-teaser#demo-video)

## Migration guide

###Â Migrating from v1 to v2

V1 -> V2 introduces the new major of o-colors, o-labels, and o-typography. Updating to this new version will mean updating any other components that you have which are using any of the updated major versions. There are no other breaking changes in this release.

### From `o-card` to `o-teaser`.

In most cases, migrating to `o-teaser` from `o-card` will be possible by simply replacing the `o-card` class prefix to `o-teaser`, i.e. `o-card__heading` becomes `o-teaser__heading`. However, there are some additional updates you will need to do, particularly around images and themes.

Images now require a containing element, with the `o-teaser__image` class on the `<img>` tag itself, see [Images](#images).

The `landscape` and `standout` themes have been removed, teasers are now responsive using `o-grid` and have a larger set of [themes](#themes).
