### Markup

Use the following markup to enable comments:

```html
<div  class="o-comments" data-o-component="o-comments">
</div>
```

This element will be initialized automatically on the `o.DOMContentReady` event meaning you're unable to defer component initialisation.

### JavaScript

No code will run automatically unless you are using the [Build Service](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/build/v2/). You must either construct an `o-comments` object or fire the `o.DOMContentLoaded` event, which oComponent listens for.

#### Constructing an o-comments

```js
const oComments = require('o-comments');
oComments.init();
```

#### Firing an oDomContentLoaded event

```js
require('o-comments');

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('o.DOMContentLoaded'));
});
```

#### Interface

##### .on(eventName, callback)

- `eventName` - *required*
- `callBack` - *required*

The `.on` interface allows you to listen for [events](#events).

```js
const oComments = require('o-comments');
const Comments = new oComments();

Comments.on('o-comments.ready', (event) => {
	console.log('The comments have rendered')
});

```


#### Events

Events are emitted during key events and can be listened to using the [`.on` interface](#on) or by listening for events on the document.

```js
document.addEventListener('o-comments.ready', (event) => {
	console.log('This comments have rendered');
});
```

##### Global / Component 

These events are anything to do with the component itself.

- **o-comments.ready** - Emitted when the component has finished rendering and is ready for the user to interact with comments 

##### Comment

These events are anything to do with comment interactions.

- **o-comments.comment.posted** - Emitted when a users has successfully left a comment
- **o-comments.comment.replied** - Emitted when a user has successfully left a comment which is a reply to an existing comment.
- **o-comments.comment.edited** - Emitted when a user has successfully edited their existing comment.
- **o-comments.comment.liked** - Emitted when a users has liked a comment

### Sass

_Remember to start your codeblocks with three backticks and "sass" so your markup is syntax highlighted correctly._

As with all Origami components, o-comments has a [silent mode](http://origami.ft.com/docs/syntax/scss/#silent-styles). To use its compiled CSS (rather than using its mixins with your own Sass) set `$o-comments-is-silent : false;` in your Sass before you import the o-comments Sass.

#### Styling of Coral Talk iframe

This component contains a sass file (/src/scss/coral-talk-iframe/main.scss) that provides custom styling for Coral Talk components inside their own iframe. That file **must only** be referenced from Coral Talk admin panel by specifying the path of the file in Origami Build Service. 

Example: `modules=o-comments@6.0.0-beta.24:/src/scss/coral-talk-iframe/main.scss`

Encoded URL: `https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/build/v2/bundles/css?modules%3Do-comments%406.0.0-beta.24%3A%2Fsrc%2Fscss%2Fcoral-talk-iframe%2Fmain.scss`

## Troubleshooting
_This is a good place to put problems that come up repeatedly_

## Contributing
If your component is particularly complicated (image sets fall into this category) then a contributing section or even a contributing.md might be useful.
