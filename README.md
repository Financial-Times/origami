## Usage

### Markup

The most minimal markup for a label is as follows:

```html
<span class="o-labels">Label</span>
```

Labels are displayed inline so including the above markup in a paragraph, for example, will make it sit alongside the text.

There are several size modifier classes which can be used to change the general appearance of a label:

```html
<span class="o-labels o-labels--big">Big Label</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--small">Small Label</span>
```

Labels can also have one of several states. The available states depend on which brand you are using (there are no states for whitelabel branded components):

#### Masterbrand

The following states are used to categorise content, mostly on FT.com:

```html
<span class="o-labels o-labels--content-commercial">Paid Post</span> (used for paid post and promoted content)
<span class="o-labels o-labels--content-premium">Premium</span> (used for premium-only content)
```

The following state is used to indicate that a feature is in a beta state:

```html
<span class="o-labels o-labels--lifecycle-beta">Beta</span>
```

#### Internal

The following states are used to represent the different support levels of Origami components:

```html
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-active">Active</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-maintained">Maintained</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-experimental">Experimental</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-deprecated">Deprecated</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-dead">Dead</span>
```

The following states are used to represent the FT's service tiers:

```html
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-platinum">Platinum</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-gold">Gold</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-silver">Silver</span>
<span class="o-labels o-labels--support-bronze">Bronze</span>
```

### Sass

#### Silent mode

As with all Origami components, o-labels has a [silent mode](http://origami.ft.com/docs/syntax/scss/#silent-styles). To use its compiled CSS (rather than incorporating its mixins into your own Sass) set `$o-labels-is-silent: false;` in your Sass before you import the o-labels Sass:

```sass
$o-labels-is-silent: false;
@import 'o-labels/main';
```

#### Mixin: `oLabels`

If using o-labels in silent mode, you'll need to use the mixins outlined here to output styles.

The `oLabels` mixin is used to output base styles as well as styles for _all_ of the label sizes and states. This output includes the `o-labels` classes:

```scss
@include oLabels();
```

```css
.o-labels {
    /* styles */
}
.o-labels--big {
    /* styles */
}
/* etc. */
```

If you wish to specify a subset of sizes and states to output styles for, you can pass in options (see [sizes](#sizes) and [states](#states) for available options):

```scss
@include oLabels($opts: (
    'sizes': ('big'),
    'states': (
        'content-commercial',
        'content-premium'
    )
));
```

#### Mixin: `oLabelsAddState`

The `oLabelsAddState` mixin can be used to output a class for one of the label states, outlined in the [states table](#states):

```scss
@include oLabelsAddState('content-commercial');
```

```css
.o-labels--content-commercial {
    /* styles */
}
```

The `oLabelsAddState` mixin also accepts optional custom configurations, which override defaults or allow you to define your own label states:

```scss
@include oLabelsAddState('citrus-fruit', (
    background-color: oColorsByName('lemon')
));
```

```css
.o-labels--citrus-fruit {
    /* styles */
}
```

#### Mixin: `oLabelsContent`

When it's not possible to use an `o-labels` CSS class, for example within another Origami component, use `oLabelsContent` to output a label with a custom class.

If it is possible to use `o-labels` classes we recommend [oLabels](#mixin-olabels) and [oLabelsAddStates](#mixin-olabelsaddstate) instead. Using these will help reduce the size of your CSS bundle where mutliple labels are used.

`oLabelsContent` accepts an `$opts` argument which is a map of options. To output styles required by all labels set "base" to "true". Then set the labels "[sizes](#size)" and its "[state](#states)". Any of these options may be output independently.

To output an existing label:
```scss
.o-example-my-label {
	@include oLabelsContent($opts: (
        'base': true,
        'size': 'big',
        'state': 'tier-gold'
    ));
}
```

To output a custom label:
```scss
.o-example-my-custom-label {
	@include oLabelsContent($opts: (
		'base': true,
		'size': 'big',
		'state': (
			'background-color': oColorsByName('lemon')
		)
	));
}
```
