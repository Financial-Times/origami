## Usage

Check out [how to include Origami components in your project](https://origami.ft.com/docs/components/#including-origami-components-in-your-project) to get started with `o-tabs`.

## Markup

The _tablist_, _tabs_ and _tabpanels_ must be identified by [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) `role` attributes.

The _tab_ elements must contain a link whose `href` attribute points to the ID of a _tabpanel_ element.

The _tabpanel_ elements must have a `o-tabs__tabpanel` class added to them.

This is an example of an HTML structure that __o-tabs__ will accept:

```html
<ul data-o-component="o-tabs" class="o-tabs" role="tablist">
	<li role="tab"><a href="#tabContent1">Tab 1</a></li>
	<li role="tab"><a href="#tabContent2">Tab 2</a></li>
	<li role="tab"><a href="#tabContent3">Tab 3</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="tabContent1" class="o-tabs__tabpanel">
	Tab content 1
</div>
<div id="tabContent2" class="o-tabs__tabpanel">
	Tab content 2
</div>
<div id="tabContent3" class="o-tabs__tabpanel">
	<div>
		Note: first elements of each tab will get focused when it is selected. In this case, this div will receive focus.
	</div>
	Tab content 3
</div>
```

To set the initially selected tab, add an `aria-selected="true"` attribute to a tab element, otherwise the first tab will be selected automatically.

### Config

You can set config options declaratively by using `[data-o-tabs-]` prefixed data attributes.

Options consist of:

- `data-o-tabs-disablefocus="true"` - prevent the tabpanel being focused when selected.
- `data-o-tabs-update-url="true"` - update the URL with the `#` of the selected panel.

### Core experience

Without the accompanying JavaScript, the _tabs_ will receive no styling, and all _tabpanels_ will remain visible. It's recommended that the default styling is to have each of the _tabpanels_ displayed one below the other.

A product may choose to hide the tabs like this:

```css
.o-tabs { display: none; }
.o-tabs--js { display: block; }
```

### ARIA

ARIA attributes will be set on elements as follows:

__On init__, `aria-controls` is added to each tab element, with value being the ID of the associated tabpanel.

__On init and selected tab change__ these attributes are set and updated as appropriate:

- `aria-selected` is set on the tab elements
- `aria-hidden` and `aria-expanded` are set on the tabpanels

These state attributes are used by the __o-tabs__ CSS.


## JavaScript

### Declarative

A `o.DOMContentLoaded` event can be dispatched on the `document` to auto-construct a __o-tabs__ object for each element with a `data-o-component="o-tabs"` attribute:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
	document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('o.DOMContentLoaded'));
});
```

Auto-construction can be disabled for a specific element via another data attribute (`data-o-tabs-autoconstruct="false"`).

Note that for browsers that do not support `DOMContentLoaded` (IE8 etc), the event could be polyfilled, or construction can be manually invoked:

```javascript
import Tabs from '@financial-times/o-tabs';
const tabsObjects = Tabs.init(document.body, {
	disablefocus: false
});
```

An array of any constructed Tabs objects will be returned.

`Tabs.init(config)` will not create Tabs objects for elements that already have Tabs objects constructed on them, therefore it's safe to call more than once on the same page region.

### Imperative

```javascript
import Tabs from '@financial-times/o-tabs';
const myTabs = new Tabs(document.getElementById('myTabsRootElement'), {
	disablefocus: false
});
```

### Events

The following events will be dispatched on the Tabs' root DOM element:

- `oTabs.ready`: The Tabs object has initialised. Event detail:
	- `tabs`: The __o-tabs__ object.
- `oTabs.tabSelect`: A tab has been selected. Event detail:
	- `tabs`: The __o-tabs__ object.
	- `selected`: The index of the selected tab.
	- `lastSelected`: The index of the last selected tab.

### API

Tabs are indexed starting from 0.

The following API methods are provided:

- `init(config)`: Set attributes/classes, bind events. Called automatically on construction. Does nothing if already been called. `config` object accepts:
	- `disablefocus`: If set to `true`, it will stop the aria-selected tab from receiving focus.
- `selectTab(idx)`: Select tab `idx`. Does nothing if tab `idx` does not exist or is already selected.
- `destroy()`: Unbind events, remove `o-tabs--js` class. After calling this, `init()` can be called again to re-initialise the tabs.

## Sass

__o-tabs__ comes with either _base styling_, which should be used as a base for you to add your own styling. Or _full styling_ called __buttontabs__; based on the buttons from [o-buttons](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-buttons)).

To apply the __buttontabs__ styling, add a `o-tabs--buttontabs` class to the root element:

```html
<ul data-o-component="o-tabs" class="o-tabs o-tabs--buttontabs" role="tablist">
```

The __buttontabs__ style comes in two sizes that conform to the `o-buttons` sizes: medium and big. Medium is the default size and big can be applied by adding the class `o-tabs--big`.

### Options

* __Align right__: Add `o-tabs--alignright` to the root element.

### Mixin: `oTabs`

Output all default `oTabs` styles using `oTabs`.

```scss
@include oTabs();
```

Set `oTabs` options to output more [sizes](#sizes) and variations of button tabs ([types](#types) and [themes](#themes) of buttons from [o-buttons](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-buttons/readme)).

```scss
@include oTabs($opts: (
	'sizes': ('big'), //.o-tabs--big
	'button-tabs': (
		('type': 'primary'), //.o-tabs--primary
		('type': 'secondary'), //.o-tabs--secondary
		('type': 'secondary', 'theme': 'inverse'), //.o-tabs--secondary.o-tabs--inverse
	)
));
```
