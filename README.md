# Origami Style Dictionary Design Token Experiment

Experimental design token repository using Style dictionary.

A hack and broken version of [Danny Banks' excellent example project](https://github.com/dbanksdesign/style-dictionary-dark-mode).

Compile assets from tokens:
```
npm install
npm build
```

Run web demo. You may need to delete `--image-logo` from `dist/variables.css` (todo: fix that):
```
cd demo/web
npm install
npm run dev
```


### Features
- Web/IOS/Android colours, sizes, and assets.
- Dark/light mode compilation.
- Project demos.
