## Usage

### Markup

Use the following HTML to get a full-width FT affiliation ribbon. This should be placed beneath a footer.

```html
<div class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon">
	<div class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__container">
		<div class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__row">
			<a class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__logo" href="https://www.ft.com/" title="The Financial Times" target="_blank">
				<span class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__visually-hidden">A service from the Financial Times</span>
			</a>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Sass

As with all Origami components, o-ft-affiliate-ribbon has a [silent mode](http://origami.ft.com/docs/syntax/scss/#silent-styles). To use its compiled CSS (rather than using its mixins with your own Sass) set `$o-ft-affiliate-ribbon-is-silent : false;` and then import the o-ft-affiliate-ribbon Sass:

```sass
	$o-ft-affiliate-ribbon-is-silent: false;
	@import 'o-ft-affiliate-ribbon/main';
```

## Migration guide

### Updating from v2 to v3

V2 -> V3 changes the design to align with the Marketing team's new design for Specialist Titles and services which replaces "Published by FINANCIAL TIMES" with "A service from the Financial Times".
The markup has changed for this component. To upgrade, make the following change:

```diff
<div class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon">
	<div class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__container">
		<div class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__row">
---			<span class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__text">Published by</span>
			<a class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__logo" href="https://www.ft.com/" title="The Financial Times" target="_blank">
+++				<span class="o-ft-affiliate-ribbon__visually-hidden">A service from the Financial Times</span>
			</a>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Updating from v1 to v2

V1 -> V2 introduces the new major of o-colors. Updating to this new version will mean updating any other components that you have which are using `o-colors`. There are no other breaking changes in this release.
