# o-icons [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/o-icons.svg?style=shield&circle-token=cf2a28827a03270506ee12ca8dfd0c233709b1a7)](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/o-icons)

SVG icon set with helper mixins and classes

## Quick start

```html
<!-- Loads the CSS for o-icons  -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//origami-build.ft.com/v2/bundles/css?modules=o-icons@^2.0.0" />

<!-- In your markup, use the helper classes, such as: -->
<i class="o-icons-icon o-icons-icon--arrow-down"></i>
```

[Complete list of available icons](http://origami-build.ft.com/v2/files/o-icons@latest/demos/all-icons.html)

## Advanced usage

There are multiple ways to use the icons:

1. Using the CSS helper classes
1. Including the predefined Sass mixins into your own CSS classes
1. Manually using the [responsive image service](https://image.webservices.ft.com)

### 1. Using the CSS helper classes

```scss
// public/bundle.scss

$o-icons-is-silent: false;
@import "o-icons/main";
```

```html
<!-- In your markup, use the helper classes, such as: -->
<i class="o-icons-icon o-icons-icon--plus"><i>
```

When using CSS classes, it isn't possible to set a colour for the icon or to specify a size for the PNG fallback. The defaults are 'black' for the icon colour and '128px' for the width and height.

### 2. Including the predefined Sass mixins into your own CSS classes

This option has the added flexibility of supporting coloured icons and PNG fallbacks of any size.

```scss
// public/bundle.scss

@import "o-icons/main";
@import "o-colors/main"; // So you can use colors from the Origami palette, but mixin accepts hex codes

.icon-plus {
	@include oIconsGetIcon('plus', oColorsGetPaletteColor('cold-1'), 32);
}
```

```html
<i class="icon-plus"></i>
```

The [responsive image service](https://image.webservices.ft.com/) helps serving resolution-independent SVG icons with a resized PNG fallback. Using the mixin from above, you'll get the following output:

```scss
.icon-plus {
	// Older browsers: PNG fallback (resized to 32px wide)
	background-image: url('//image.webservices.ft.com/v1/images/raw/fticon:plus?width=32&format=png&source=o-icons');
	// Modern browsers: SVG covering the whole size of the element
	// we declare multiple backgrounds so that only modern browsers read this property
	background-image: url('//image.webservices.ft.com/v1/images/raw/fticon:plus?format=svg&source=o-icons'), none;

	display: inline-block;
	width: 32px;
	height: 32px;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: contain;
	background-position: 50%;
	background-color: transparent;
	vertical-align: middle;
}
```

The 'base' of the service url can be set with the `$o-icons-service-base-url` variable. e.g. setting

```
$o-icons-service-base-url: "https://my.image.service/foo";
```

will output an image service url in the format `https://my.image.service/foo/v1/images/raw/...`.

There's also a separate mixin to output just the base styles for an icon:

```scss
.icon {
	@include oIconsBaseStyles;
}
```

Which outputs:

```scss
.icon {
	display: inline-block;
	width: 128px;
	height: 128px;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: contain;
	background-position: 50%;
	background-color: transparent;
	vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### 3. Manually using the [responsive image service](https://image.webservices.ft.com)

If you can't use the mixins, and you need to see a custom size or colour, you can also use the [responsive image service](https://image.webservices.ft.com) to fetch the icons in a very similar way as to how the mixin works:

```scss
element {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;

    // Older browsers: PNG fallback (resized to 100px wide)
    background-image: url('//image.webservices.ft.com/v1/images/raw/fticon:tick?width=100&format=png&source=my-product');

    // Modern browsers: SVG covering the whole size of the element
    // we declare multiple backgrounds so that only modern browsers read this property
    background-image: url('//image.webservices.ft.com/v1/images/raw/fticon:tick?format=svg&source=my-product'), none;
    background-size: cover;
}
```

## Add / edit icons, build the  demo page

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

		git clone https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-icons.git
		cd o-icons
		obt install

1. Add or edit an SVG file to the `svg` folder (see [SVG file naming rules](#svg-file-naming-rules)).
1. The `_icon-list.scss` file and the `data.json` file used for demos are generated by a Gulp task. When adding a new icon, these files need to be rebuilt. You just need to run:

		gulp

1. Check the rendering locally (on [http://localhost:8080/demos/local](http://localhost:8080/demos/local)):

		obt demo --runServer

### SVG version

The icons module uses SVG version 1.1. Files can be created in any vector graphics software. In Adobe Illustrator use the "save as" function and set to version 1.1

### SVG file naming rules

The file must be named according to the following rules:

1. All lower case
2. Contains only letters, numbers and hyphens (no spaces)
3. Ends with `.svg`

Good: `columnists.svg`, `back-arrow.svg`
Bad: `RightArrow.svg`, `linked_in.svg`, `yahoo!.svg`

##Â Deprecation process

Icon sets can't be versioned so, when removing an icon, make sure that it isn't used anywhere. To find out if they're being used, search on [Splunk](http://splunk.internal.ft.com). An example search:

> (host="ftweb61759-law1b-eu-p" OR host="ftweb61758-law1a-eu-p") source="/var/log/httpd/access_log" fticon:section-world| top limit=120 referer

Where you can change _section-world_ for the icon you're looking for.

The list of icons that are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release can be found [here](_deprecated.js)

## How to upgrade from v3.x.x to v4.x.x?

### Important changes

* `o-ft-icons` has been renamed to `o-icons`
* Icon font has been removed, now it's SVGs all the way. This changes the behaviour for silent mode turned off users which includes Build Service users
* Many icons have been removed, and as mentioned above, others have been deprecated. The list of deleted icons is:
	- brand-always-learning
	- brand-fast-ft
	- brand-fast
	- brand-myft
	- brand-pearson
	- eye
	- font-size
	- gift
	- section-columnists
	- section-house-and-home
	- section-leader-and-letters
	- section-lex
	- section-markets-data
	- section-money
	- section-uk

### Markup changes

CSS now doesn't add any pseudoclasses, so all the styling is applied directly on the element

### CSS Changes

* Class prefixes need to be renamed from `o-ft-icons` to `o-icons`

	e.g.

	`o-ft-icons-icon` to `o-icons-icon`
	`o-ft-icons-icon--arrow-down` to `o-icons-icon--arrow-down`

* As it's an SVG instead of a font, size is now set using the CSS properties `width` and `height`

### Sass Changes

* All icon font related mixins have been removed
* `oFtIconsBaseIconStyles` has been renamed to `oIconsBaseStyles`
* `oFtIconsGetSvg` has been renamed to `oIconsGetIcon`

### Silent mode off Changes

When using the [Build Service](https://origami-build.ft.com), you're using this module with silent mode turned off. Due to the removal of the icon font, there are a couple things to keep in mind in the new implementation:

* There is a PNG fallback, and when using the default CSS classes, the size of the image served is _128px_ so it can be resized down, but not up
* The colour of the icon served is _black_. This cannot be changed. If you need a custom colour (or even a custom size), [option 3](#3-manually-using-the-responsive-image-service) of the suggested ways of using this module is the way to go
