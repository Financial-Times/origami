## Markup

These elements will be initialized automatically on the `o.DOMContentReady` event meaning you're unable to defer component initialisation.

### Stream

Use the following markup to enable a comment stream:

```html
<div class="o-comments"
	id="o-comments-stream"
	data-o-component="o-comments"
	data-o-comments-article-id="{article-id}">
</div>
```
The comment stream is embedded in the element with a `o-comments-stream` id attribute.

### Count

Add the following attribute to the markup to enable a comment count:

```diff
<div class="o-comments"
-	id="o-comments-stream"
	data-o-component="o-comments"
	data-o-comments-article-id="{article-id}"
+	data-o-comments-count="true">
</div>
```

The comment count is rendered when the `data-o-comments-count` attribute value is `true`.

## JavaScript

No code will run automatically unless you are using the [Build Service](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/build/v2/). You must either construct an `o-comments` object or fire the `o.DOMContentLoaded` event, which o-comments listens for.

### Constructing an o-comments

Assuming you have an HTML element on the page to represent your comment stream or count:

```js
const oComments = require('o-comments');
const commentsElement = document.querySelector('#element');
const Comments = new oComments(commentsElement, {
	articleId: 'article-id'
})
```

If you want to initialise every comment stream or count element on the page (based on the presence of the attribute: `data-o-component="o-comments"`):

```js
const oComments = require('o-comments');
oComments.init();
```

### Firing an oDomContentLoaded event

```js
require('o-comments');

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('o.DOMContentLoaded'));
});
```

### Interface

#### .on(eventName, callback)

- `eventName` - *required*
- `callBack` - *required*

The `.on` interface allows you to listen for [events](#events).

```js
const oComments = require('o-comments');
const Comments = new oComments();

Comments.on('o-comments.ready', (event) => {
	console.log('The comments have rendered')
});

```

### Events

Events are emitted during key events and can be listened to using the [`.on` interface](#on) or by listening for events on the document.

```js
document.addEventListener('o-comments.ready', (event) => {
	console.log('This comments have rendered');
});
```

#### Global / Component

These events are anything to do with the component itself.

- **o-comments.ready** - Emitted when the component has finished rendering and is ready for the user to interact with comments

#### Comment

These events are anything to do with comment interactions.

- **o-comments.comment.posted** - Emitted when a users has successfully left a comment
- **o-comments.comment.replied** - Emitted when a user has successfully left a comment which is a reply to an existing comment.
- **o-comments.comment.edited** - Emitted when a user has successfully edited their existing comment.
- **o-comments.comment.liked** - Emitted when a users has liked a comment

## Sass
_Remember to start your codeblocks with three backticks and "sass" so your markup is syntax highlighted correctly._

As with all Origami components, o-comments has a [silent mode](http://origami.ft.com/docs/syntax/scss/#silent-styles). To use its compiled CSS (rather than using its mixins with your own Sass) set `$o-comments-is-silent : false;` in your Sass before you import the o-comments Sass.

## Troubleshooting
_This is a good place to put problems that come up repeatedly_

## Contributing
If your component is particularly complicated (image sets fall into this category) then a contributing section or even a contributing.md might be useful.
