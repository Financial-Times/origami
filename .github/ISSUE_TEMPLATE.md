<!--
If proposing a new Origami component, please ensure that you have checked both the Origami Registry and the Component Backlog for similar components:

Registry: https://registry.origami.ft.com/
Backlog: https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-proposals/projects/1

If you need help with putting your proposal together then please
contact the Origami team at origami.support@ft.com or
#origami-support on Slack.
-->


## What

> Give a brief description of the component or pattern you wish to propose. This should be a short pitch so that we can quickly spot duplicate components, or previously proposed patterns.
> If proposing a new component, it's helpful in this section to also suggest alternative names, e.g. a loading indicator could also be known as a "spinner".


## Why

> Explain why you think Origami should accept the proposal.
>
> E.g. When proposing a new component:
> - What evidence do you have that it's needed by multiple teams across the FT?
> - What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of the users of those teams?
>
> E.g. When proposing a pattern:
> - What problem does the proposal aim to address?
> - Are there any known caveats to the proposal?
> - Which components, if any, would be affected by the proposal if it were accepted?
> - How would the proposal, if accepted, impact your workflow or that of other Origami users?


## Supporting Examples

> Include links to examples, research, or code to support your proposal, if any is available. It's also useful to have links to designs if there are any
