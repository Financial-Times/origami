## What

> Give a brief description of the component you wish to propose. This should be a short pitch so that we can quickly spot duplicated. It's helpful in this section to also suggest alternative names, e.g. a loading indicator could also be known as a "spinner"


## Why

> Explain why you think this should be added to Origami or maintained by the Origami team.
>
> - What evidence do you have that it's needed by multiple teams across the FT?
> - What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of the users of those teams?


## Supporting Examples

> Include links to examples, research, or code to support your proposal, if any is available. It's also useful to have links to designs if there are any
