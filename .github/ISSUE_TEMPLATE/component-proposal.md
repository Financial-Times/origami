## What

> Give a brief description of the component you're proposing. Make it a short pitch so that we can quickly spot duplicate components.
>
> It's helpful in this section to suggest alternative names, e.g. a loading indicator could also be known as a "spinner".

## Why

> Explain why you think Origami should accept the proposal.
>
> E.g. When proposing a new component:
> - Do you have evidence that it's needed by multiple teams across the FT?
> - Do you have evidence that it meets the needs of the users of those teams?

## Supporting Examples

> Include links to examples, research, or code to support your proposal, if any is available.
>
> It's also useful to have links to designs if there are any.
