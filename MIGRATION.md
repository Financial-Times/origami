# Migration Guide

## Migrating from v8 to v9

v9 drops support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service.

Follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).


## Migrating from v7 to v8

v8 removes support for the internal brand. Consider using [o-header-services](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-header-services) instead, or contact the Origami team to discuss bring back support for the internal brand.

### Updated dependencies

The dependencies for this component have all been updated to the latest major versions.
If you have any conflicts while installing this version, you'll need to first update
its dependencies. See [the Bower config for these](./bower.json).

### Markup

`aria-selected` is no longer used to style current links. If your project is still using `aria-selected` in header markup replace it with `aria-current="page"`.

### Sass

Origami components now require a `$system-code` Sass variable is set by the project, which must be a valid [Bizops system code](https://biz-ops.in.ft.com/list/Systems).

The following Sass variables have been removed:
- `$o-header-image-service-version`
- `$o-header-image-base-url`

The first `oHeader` argument is now an options map `$opts`, rather than `$features`, to align with other Origami components.

```diff
-@include oHeader($features: ('drawer', 'sticky'));
+@include oHeader($opts: ('drawer', 'sticky'));
```

The following Sass mixins have been removed and should be replaced with a single call to `oHeader` and the appropriate `$opts` argument.

- `oHeaderBase`: included by default in base styles
- `oHeaderTop`: included by default in base styles
- `oHeaderAnon`: 'anon' feature
- `oHeaderDrawer`: 'drawer' feature
- `oHeaderMegaMenu`: 'megamenu' feature
- `oHeaderNav`: 'nav' feature
- `oHeaderSearch`: 'search' feature
- `oHeaderSimple`: 'simple' feature
- `oHeaderSticky`: 'sticky' feature
- `oHeaderSubnav`: 'subnav' feature
- `oHeaderSubbrand`: 'subbrand' feature
- `oHeaderTransparent`: 'transparent' feature

E.g. to output the header with select features:
```diff
-@include oHeaderBase;
-@include oHeaderTop;
-@include _oHeaderDrawer;
-@include _oHeaderSticky;
+@include oHeader($opts: ('drawer', 'sticky');
```

Or to output only base styles:
```diff
-@include oHeaderBase;
-@include oHeaderTop;
+@include oHeader($opts: ());
```

Or to output only extra features without the base styles required by all features:
```diff
-@include _oHeaderDrawer;
-@include _oHeaderSticky;
+@include oHeader($opts: ('drawer', 'sticky'), $include-base-styles: false);
```

There is no direct replacement for the following mixins. Please contact the Origami team if you have a usecase for these:
- `oHeaderLink`
- `oHeaderFancyLink`
- `oHeaderItemSeparator`
- `oHeaderLogoSize`
- `oHeaderBrandImage`

Also replace `oHeaderVisuallyHidden` with the o-normalise mixin [oNormaliseVisuallyHidden](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-normalise/sassdoc).

Finally [all deprecated colour usecases](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-header/blob/v7.8.12/src/scss/_deprecated.scss) have been removed. Please contact the Origami team if your project requires these.

## Migrating from v6 to v7

V7 introduces new major versions of `o-colors`, `o-typography`, `o-buttons` and `o-visual-effects`. Updating to this new version will mean updating any other components that you have which are using `o-colors`, `o-typography`, `o-buttons`, or `o-visual-effects`. There are no other breaking changes in this release.

## Migrating from v5 to v6

This is a complete change in the markup and usage of the module, so we advise to look at the markup in the demos and go over the readme. If any issues come up, please let us know.
