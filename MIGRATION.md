## Migration

### Migrating from v4 to v5

The dependency `dom-delegate` has been replaced by `ftdomdelegate`. If your project depends on `dom-delegate`, switch to `ftdomdelegate@^3.0.0` instead -- their api is the same, but `dom-delegate` is now deprecated. Ensure your project builds without conflicts.
