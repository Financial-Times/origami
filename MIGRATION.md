## Migration guide

### Migrating from v2 to v3

Support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service have been removed.

Follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).

### Migrating from v1 to v2

v2 updates its o-colors dependency to a new major and introduces a dependency on o-typography and o-spacing. Ensure your project dependencies do not conflict and update these components if required.

v2 also updates the Sass mixin `oBigNumber` to output all o-big-number CSS. We recommend including CSS using `oBigNumber` and using default o-big-number markup. If you are unable to update your to o-big-number markup, use `oBigNumberTitle` to style the title element and continue to use `oBigNumberContent` to style the content element.

#### Updated dependencies

The dependencies for this component have all been updated to the latest major versions.
If you have any conflicts while installing this version, you'll need to first update
its dependencies. See [the Bower config for these](./bower.json).
