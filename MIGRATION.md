_Migration guides are very important! Always include one for major releases. To create a codeblock that has diff highligting, use three backticks followed by the word diff_

### Migrating from 1.X.X to 2.X.X

The 2.0.0 release changes the default behaviour of o-meter.

```diff
<div class="o-meter__container">
- remove this line
+ add this line
</div>
```
