## Migration guide

### Migrating from v6 to v7

The mixin `oFooter` has been updated. By default it now outputs all o-footer styles. To upgrade explicitly include the styles your project needs using the options `$opts` map:

`oFooter` previously included the complex "matrix" navigation structure with dark theme by default:
```diff
-@include oFooter;
+@include oFooter($opts: (
+    'themes': ('dark'),
+    'matrix': true,
+));
```

Instead of setting `$theme` update the `theme` key in the options map:
```diff
-@include oFooter($theme: 'light');
+@include oFooter($opts: (
+    'themes': ('light'),
+    'matrix': true,
+));
```

Instead of turning off output for the matrix of links by setting `$simple: true`, do not set the `matrix` option:
```diff
- @include oFooter($simple: true);
+@include oFooter($opts: (
+    'themes': ('dark')
+));
```

To remove the default margin set the `margin` option to false (alternatively set the top margin value):
```diff
- @include oFooter($margin: false);
+@include oFooter($opts: (
+    'margin': null
+));
```

The following Sass has been made private or removed and must not be used. Instead use the `oFooter` mixin with related options. Please contract the Origami team if there are any extra options required by your project:
    - `$o-footer-matrix`
    - `$o-footer-spacing-unit`
    - `oFooterBrandImage`
    - `oFooterMatrix`
    - `oFooterThemeDark`
    - `oFooterThemeLight`

### Migrating from v5 to v6

V5 -> V6 introduces the new majors of o-colors and o-typography. Updating to this new version will mean updating any other components that you have which are using o-colors and o-typography. There are no other breaking changes in this release.

### Migrating from v4 to v5
Version 5 has significant markup changes compared to version 4. If you want to upgrade, the best option is to look at the demos: [footer](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-footer/blob/master/demos/src/footer.mustache) and [simple footer](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-footer/blob/master/demos/src/simple-footer.mustache).
If you don't want to upgrade, some superficial visual changes have been back-ported to a minor version on 4.x.x.


### Migrating from v3 to v4


Note that o-footer v4 relies on o-grid v4.

#### Markup changes

```diff
 <nav class="o-footer__row o-footer__nav">
 	<div class="o-footer__col o-footer__col--full-width">
 		â€¦
+ 		<div class="o-footer__divider"></div>
 	</div>
 </nav>
```
