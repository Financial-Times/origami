## Migration Guide

### Migrating from v2 to v3

Confirm the `o-teaser-collection__heading--inverse` modifier is used with `o-teaser-collection__heading`. I.e. `o-teaser-collection__heading o-teaser-collection__heading--inverse`. This was optional before.

`oTeaserCollection` has changed, it now outputs all `o-teaser-collection` css by default. See the [README](./README.md) for `oTeaserCollection` options to include css granularly.

#### Renamed Mixins
- `oTeaserCollectionHeading` has been renamed `oTeaserCollectionContentHeading` to indicate it has no top level selector. It now excepts an `$opts` map to include parts of the heading more granularly (such as styles for a child anchor tag). See the README for more details.

#### Removed Mixins

If your project uses these mixins replace with a single call to `oTeaserCollection` instead. See the README for `oTeaserCollection` options.
- oTeaserCollectionAssassination
- oTeaserCollectionStream
- oTeaserCollectionFrontPage
- oTeaserCollectionHeadingInverse
- oTeaserCollectionItems
- oTeaserCollectionItemStretched
- oTeaserCollectionNumbered
- oTeaserCollectionSpecial
- oTeaserCollectionBigStory
- oTeaserCollectionHorizontal
- oTeaserCollectionMidSlice
- oTeaserCollectionTopStandalone


`oTeaserCollectionHeadingLink` has also been removed. If your project is using this mixin to avoid outputting the heading border (divider) use `oTeaserCollectionContentHeading` without the `divider` or `sizes` option. This will output the base heading styles plus the child anchor styles, without the divider.
```diff
.my-heading {
-   // Custom styles replicating the collection heading.
-	@include oTypographySize(3);
-	a {
-		@include oTeaserCollectionHeadingLink;
-	}
+	@include oTeaserCollectionContentHeading($opts: ('anchor': true));
}
```

`oTeaserCollectionHeadingBorderTypography` has been removed. Replace with a call to `oTeaserCollectionContentHeading` without the `anchor` option.
```diff
.my-heading {
-   @include oTeaserCollectionHeadingBorderTypography;
+	@include oTeaserCollectionContentHeading($opts: (
+       'divider': true,
+       'sizes': ('full-width', 'half-width', 'small') // .my-heading--small, etc.
+   ));
}
```

#### Dependencies

v3 updates its dependecy on `o-icons`. Confirm your project builds correctly and resolve any conflicts.

### Migrating from v1 to v2

- Deprecated classname `.o-teaser-collection--top-top-stories` has now been removed. __Resolution__ Please use `.o-teaser-collection--top-standalone` instead.
- Styles for `.o-teaser-collection--stream .o-teaser__action` have been removed.
- The o-colors and o-typography dependencies have been bumped to the latest major. These will create bower conflicts which should be resolved by updating to the newest release of o-colors and o-typography.
