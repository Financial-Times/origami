## Migration

### Migrating from v1 to v2
v1 was released with Sass mixins and functions which do not conform to the Origami specification. v2 was released shortly after the release of v1 to correct these:
- `oSpaceByName` becomes `oSpacingByName`.
- `oSpaceByIncrement` becomes `oSpacingByIncrement`.
- `getBaselineValue` becomes `oSpacingGetBaselineValue`.
