## Migration Guide

### Migrating from v7 to v8

### Migrating from v6 to v7

V7 introduces new major versions of `o-colors`, `o-typography`, `o-buttons` and `o-visual-effects`. Updating to this new version will mean updating any other components that you have which are using `o-colors`, `o-typography`, `o-buttons`, or `o-visual-effects`. There are no other breaking changes in this release.

### Migrating from v5 to v6

This is a complete change in the markup and usage of the module, so we advise to look at the markup in the demos and go over the readme. If any issues come up, please let us know.
