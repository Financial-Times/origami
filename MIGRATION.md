## Migration Guide

### Migrating from v2 to v3

Support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service have been removed.

Follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).

### Migrating from v1 to v2

The event `o.load` has been removed as it [appears not to be used](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-autoinit/issues/14). Please contact the Origami team if your project requires the `o.load` event.
