# Migration

### Migrating from v3 to v4

Support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service have been removed.

Follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).

## Migrating from v2 to v3

### Updated dependencies

The dependencies for this component have all been updated to the latest major versions.
If you have any conflicts while installing this version, you'll need to first update
its dependencies. See [the Bower config for these](./bower.json).

### Sass

Origami components now require a `$system-code` variable is set by the project, which must be a valid [Bizops system code](https://biz-ops.in.ft.com/list/Systems).

All mixins have been replaced with `oFooterServices`, except `oFooterServicesLink` which has been removed entirely (please contact Origami if you have any questions or feedback).

Multiple `o-footer-services` mixin calls should be replaced with one call to `oFooterServices` with the options required by your project.

- `oFooterServicesBase` may be replaced by setting the `oFooterServices` `$opts` argument with the icons your footer uses as links:
```diff
- @include oFooterServicesBase();
+ @include oFooterServices($opts: (
+ 	'icons': ('slack', 'github')
+ ));
```

- `oFooterServicesWithLogo` has been removed. Instead pass a `logo` option to `oFooterServices`, which includes the image set `ftlogo-v1` to get the logo from (also specify the icons your footer uses as links):
```diff
- @include oFooterServicesWithLogo($logo: 'origami');
+ @include oFooterServices($opts: (
+ 	'logo': 'ftlogo-v1:origami',
+ 	'icons': ('slack', 'github')
+ ));
```

- `oFooterServicesIcons` has been removed. Instead add to the `oFooterServices` `icons` option and update your markup to use the `o-footer-services` class (`o-footer-services__icon-link--[icon-name]`):
```diff
- .my-custom-share-icon-link {
-     @include oFooterServicesIcons('share');
- }
+ @include oFooterServices($opts: (
+ 	'logo': 'ftlogo-v1:origami',
+ 	'icons': ('slack', 'github','share')
+ ));
```
```diff
- <a class="o-footer-services__icon-link my-custom-share-icon-link" href="#">share</a>
+ <a class="o-footer-services__icon-link o-footer-services__icon-link--share" href="#">share</a>
```

- Many of the replaced mixins above accepted a `$class` argument to customise the class names output by `o-footer-services`. This feature has been removed, instead update your markup to use default `o-footer-services` classes.

## Migrating from v1 to v2

This major includes a change in markup and an entirely new design, which is compliant with legal requirements within internal FT tooling and products.

All previous variations of the footer have been discontinued. To illustrate the change in markup, this difference is between the full footer and the new footer that has been introduced with this major:

```diff
<footer class="o-footer-services">
	<div class="o-footer-services__container">

```

`o-footer-services--wide` is no longer an available class.
