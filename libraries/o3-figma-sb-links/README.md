## Usage

`o3-figma-sb-links` exports a json file that contains links to Figma and Storybook for the O3 components. The links can be retrieved by story ids. Story ids are retrieved using [@storybook/csf-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/csf-tools) package. Example of `.stories` file:

```jsx
export default {
 title: 'Core/o3-button'
};
export const Button = ButtonStories.Button;
export const ButtonSmall = ButtonStories.ButtonSmall;
```

The story IDs are composite of title and exported component name. In our case title is combination of `BRAND` and `COMPONENT` and component name is `VARIANT`. The story ID is then:

```txt
core-o3-button--button
[BRAND]-[COMPONENT]--[VARIANT]

core-o3-button--button-small
[BRAND]-[COMPONENT]--[VARIANT]

```

To use the links in your project, import the links from the package:

```js
import links from "@financial-times/o3-figma-sb-links";
```

json structure:

```json
{
 "STORY-ID-1": {
  "figma": "FIGMA-LINK",
  "sb": "STORYBOOK-LINK"
 },
 "STORY-ID-2": {
  "figma": "FIGMA-LINK",
  "sb": "STORYBOOK-LINK"
 }
}
```

where figma links are absolute links to the Figma files and sb links are relative paths to provided hostname.
