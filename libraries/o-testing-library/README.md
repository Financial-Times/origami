## Usage

We are using [web-test-runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) to run our component tests. `web-test-runner` does not like NPM packages published as commonjs modules and we started getting errors that `require is not defined`. Investigating issue it seemed that error originated from two packages `@testing-library/dom` and `@testing-library/user-event`.

This module is bundling the [DOM testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library) and [user-event](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/) modules to `ESM` modules. It is intended to be used in Origami components and applications to provide a consistent way of testing. Now you can import both modules from the same place with the following import:

```JS
import userEvent, {dom} from '@financial-times/o-testing-library';

```
