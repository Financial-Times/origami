## What
Provide a way to express that a component is safe to be used with any brand.

## Why

e.g. https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-toggle@2.1.2 says 

> o-toggle hasn't been branded yet, it only supports the master brand. 

despite it not containing any of its own styles and being compatible with any brand.
