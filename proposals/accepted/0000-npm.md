# Proposal: npm-only origami components

## motivation

there is so much motivation!!

- Teams across the FT are moving away from `bower`, and the Origami Team are meant to serve those teams.


- The `origami-component-converter` project that builds npm versions of our bower components is really confusing for users, and is horrible to maintain!

- There are new ideas we have to make Origami easier to use. Switching to dart-sass, making hot-reloadable templates, multirepos, \[...others], that will be much easier to do when using npm and not needing to support bower anymore.

- dependencies we want to use that exist only on npm, we just don't use at the moment

- we currently maintain our own bundler because there aren't other modern bundlers that support both npm and bower. A bundler is a complex piece of work, which means less time spent on work that more directly helps people

- the javascript ecosystem has moved on, and we haven't.

- the npm client is now ready to support us. npmv7's automatic install of `peerDependencies` will allow us to maintain a flat origami tree in apps.

## explanation

We stop supporting bower!

We delete `bower.json` from our components and we convert them to npm components, moving the dependencies into the `package.json`.

We'll be bumping the `origamiVersion` from `1` to `"2.0.0"`, so our services and tools know to process the component as an npm component.

## work required

- Specification
	- Create Draft Specification
		- Require npm 7+
		- Replace Bower references with npm
		- Require `peerDependencies` are used, never `dependencies`, to ensure flatness
		- @todo any other `package.json` restrictions to add or remove?
		- Add that demos are not part of the Origami API explicitly, to support future work
		- Require dart-sass, to support future work
- Communications
	- Create a communications plan:
	- Ensure users are involved in the proposal; and
	- Ensure users are prepared to switch to npm and dart within x months, we'll need to maintain multiple versions of components in the meantime; and
	- Communicate the value across the business
- Origami CI Tools
	- Update `origami-ci-tools` so it may publish v2 components, e.g. [without using occ](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-ci-tools/blob/9083d70dbba7da78a4ffcb8bc84211720e844cca/commands/release.js#L42)
- Test Component
	- Create v2 test components to support tool and service work
	- Publish a `o-test-component` version with Sass and JavaScript, which conforms to spec v2, and depends on a new `o-test-component-dependency` v2 component
- Build Tools
	- Support v1 and v2 components conditionally by checking `origamiVersion`:
	- Build v2 [demos without relying on bower.json](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-build-tools/blob/ec4ae8354a05f0495e38a30117e126b3674fbb9e/lib/tasks/demo-build.js#L28)
	- Add tests to cover Origami Build Tools features with v1 and v2 components
- Build Service
	- Install the component, e.g:
		- Attempt an npm install, fall back to bower on error; or
		- Make a request to Repo Data and install via npm if v2; or
		- Install via npm by default. Maintain a list of all v1 component major versions to install via bower
	- Build the component:
		- Check the Origami version in origami.json
		- Conditionally build the component based on the src for v1 or npm bundle for v2
		- @todo what does the above involve?
- Repo Data
	- Add `origamiVersion` to the repository/version entities
	- Include `peerDependencies` in the [repository/version dependencies](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-repo-data/blob/b6c3d64525680f5134f6081be7450e88ffdf555e/models/version.js#L143)
	- Add `isPeer` to the [Dependencies entity](https://origami-repo-data.ft.com/v1/docs/api/repositories#entity-dependency)
	- It may be that no other changes are required since repo data already supports non-component projects. Add tests to confirm.
	- E.g. that for a v2 component `package` is added to the `manifests` key, bower is null as with non-component projects
	- E.g. npm dependencies, including peer dependencies, are returned in repository/version entities
	- E.g. v1 behaviour doesn't change
	- Add an `origamiVersion` filter to the [repos endpoint](https://origami-repo-data.ft.com/v1/docs/api/repositories#get-v1-repos)
- Registry UI
	- Test the registry displays `o-test-component`, `o-test-component-dependency` correctly. This may not be the case if, for example, the Registry assumes the [repo data registry/version entity](https://origami-repo-data.ft.com/v1/docs/api/repositories#entity-repo) has a bower manifest. It doesn't appear to make such an assumption. The registry may just work since it also deals with non-components. E.g. it will [already display npm dependencies](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-registry-ui/blob/42fac8202a5c9f7f960ec4091bbedd78903cc9c4/lib/routes/components.js#L283) provided Repo Data is updated.
	- Add an `origamiVersion` filter to the right hand sidebar with options all, v1, v2. Default to all so not to hide components.
	- Display a v2 badge on the component listing and in the right hand sidebar on the component page.
- Origami Workshop
	- Confirm the [origami workshop](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-workshop) CLI works with `origamiVersion` v2 components
- Create Origami Component
	- Update [create-origami-component](https://github.com/Financial-Times/create-origami-component) to create a v2 component
- Origami Website
	- Version the specification, so the v1 specification is still available
	- Publish the v2 specification
	- Add a `origamiVersion` migration guide
	- Update all documentation and tutorials to reflect v2. With references to v1, i.e. as asides or links to a document explaining the difference, where needed whilst users migrate
- Components
	- Update all Origami team maintained components to support `origamiVersion` v2, including `README` updates e.g. to remove any existing bower/npm reference and use the correct `import` path
	- Work with other teams to update components they maintain. It may be they are less willing to maintain two versions and will release a major at the same time as upgrading end projects
- Other Origami Projects
	- Any project which an `origami.json` which isn't affected should release a `minor` which updates the `origamiVersion` to `v2`. This is so it appears up-to-date and is returned when filtering for `v2`, i.e. in the Registry or via Repo Data.

## alternatives

### do nothing

we can continue being an old-fashioned drag and suffer the consequences

## supporting examples

i don't know... every other modern component system i guess
