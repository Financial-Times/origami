# Proposal: npm-only origami components

## motivation

there is so much motivation!!

- Teams across the FT are moving away from `bower`, and the Origami Team are meant to serve those teams.

- Often^\[citation\ needed]^ the only reason someone^\[who\]^ is installing `bower` is because they need to use Origami.

- The `origami-component-converter` project that builds npm versions of our bower components is really confusing for users, and is horrible to maintain!

- There are new ideas we have to make Origami easier to use. Switching to dart-sass, making hot-reloadable templates, multirepos, \[...others], that will be much easier to do when using npm and not needing to support bower anymore.

- dependencies we want to use that exist only on npm, we just don't use at the moment

- we currently maintain our own bundler because there aren't other modern bundlers that support both npm and bower.

- the javascript ecosystem has moved on, and we haven't.

- the npm client is now ready to support us. npmv7's automatic install of `peerDependencies` will allow us to maintain a flat origami tree in apps.

## explanation

We stop supporting bower!

We delete `bower.json` from our components and we convert them to npm components, moving the dependencies into the `package.json`.

We'll be bumping the `origamiVersion` from `1` to `"2.0.0"`, so our services and tools know to process the component as an npm component.

## work required

- Specification
	- Create a v2 specification:
		- Replace Bower references with npm alternatives
		- Update current package.json restrictions
		- Add that demos are not part of the Origami API explicitly, to support future v2.1 work
		- Require dart-sass, to support future work
- All The Components
	- Assume a new Origami specification, v2, which removes bower support for npm 7+.
	- Create an o-test-component component which conforms to spec v2 and depends on a v2 compoennt o-test-component-dependency.
- Build Service
	- Install the component:
		- Attempt an npm install, fall back to bower on error
		- Make a request to Repo Data and install via npm if v2
		- Install via npm by default. Maintain a list of all v1 component major versions to install via bower.
	- Build the component:
		- Check the Origami version in origami.json
		- Conditionally build the component based on the src for v1 or npm bundle for v2
		- @todo what does the above involve?
- Repo Data
	- It may be that no changes are required since repo data already supports non-component projects. Add tests to confirm.
	- E.g. that for a v2 component `package` is added to the `manifests` key, bower is null as with non-component projects
	- E.g. npm dependencies are returned in repository/version entities
	- E.g. v1 behaviour doesn't change
- Registry UI
	- Test the registry displays o-test-component, o-test-component correctly. This may not be the case if, for example, the Registry assumes the [repo data registry/version entity](https://origami-repo-data.ft.com/v1/docs/api/repositories#entity-repo) has a bower manifest. It doesn't appear to make such an assumption. The registry may just work since it also deals with non-components. E.g. it will [already display npm dependencies](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-registry-ui/blob/42fac8202a5c9f7f960ec4091bbedd78903cc9c4/lib/routes/components.js#L283) provided Repo Data is updated.

## alternatives

### do nothing

we can continue being an old-fashioned drag and suffer the consequences

## supporting examples

i don't know... every other modern component system i guess
