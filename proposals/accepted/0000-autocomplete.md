# Autocomplete
## What

A component to allow search/filtering of a dataset with "suggested search" autocomplete behaviour. A common use is in search bars but could apply to other contexts.

## Why

Laura C has requested autocomplete for internal products. O&R have requested autocomplete. It has also been requested directly by multiple people/teams in #ft-origami over the years. More recently Elena's team have one based loosely on the MyFT one, and Joanna has asked for autocomplete suggestions in the engineering channel "We’ve got a dataset of 2 million rows, and we’d like to build a search/autocomplete service around it.".
