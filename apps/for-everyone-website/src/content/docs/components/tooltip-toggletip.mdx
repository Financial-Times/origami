Toggletips are compact pieces of information designed to offer additional insights when needed.

- Contain only descriptive text without any formatting.
- Should provide relevant information that may be helpful, but is not required.
- Hidden by default.
- Toggle visibility through user interaction with the info icon.

## Anatomy

<ToggletipAnatomy />

1. <strong>Trigger</strong>: A compact, circular icon marked with an information symbol that activates the toggletip's visibility.
2. <strong>Text</strong>: The main content providing detailed explanation or information.
4. <strong>Arrow</strong>: A directional arrow that can point towards any side, indicating the source of the information or context.
5. <strong>Container</strong>: The encompassing frame that holds the message text and ensures it's distinct from other UI elements.
