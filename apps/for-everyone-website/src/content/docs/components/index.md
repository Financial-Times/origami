description: What is an Origami component?
---

A component is a self contained piece of user interface, from buttons to tables. These may be brought together like building blocks to create new [patterns](/patterns) and products. Allowing the team to focus on where their product adds unique value.

In the past, Origami considered "o3-button" a component. In reality this is a "package" of multiple components and pattens, e.g:

- Primary button
- Secondary button
- Ghost button
- Grouped buttons
- Pagination
