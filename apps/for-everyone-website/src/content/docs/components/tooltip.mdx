There are two kinds of tooltips available:

- [Onboarding Tooltips](#onboarding-tooltips), to facilitate an introduction to new features or functionality.
- [Toggle Tooltips](#toggle-tooltips), to provide additional contextual information.

## Onboarding Tooltips

Onboarding Tooltips help for a smoother introduction to new features or functionality.

- Contain only descriptive unformatted text with an optional title for emphasis.
- Should provide insights or tips that enhance, but aren't critical to, user understanding.
- Appear only once; dismissing them removes them permanently.

### Anatomy

1. <strong>Heading (optional)</strong>: It's best to omit the tooltip heading as
   emphasis cannot be portrayed to screen reader users. Employ a heading only
   for presentational reasons, provided emphasis is not required for
   understanding.
2. <strong>Text</strong>: The main content pro viding detailed explanation or
   information.
3. <strong>Close button (Ã—)</strong>: This button dismisses the tooltip. Once
   closed, the tooltip should not reappear for the user.
4. <strong>Arrow</strong>: A directional arrow that can point towards any side,
   indicating the source of the information or context.
5. <strong>Container</strong>: The encompassing frame that holds the message
   text and ensures it's distinct from other UI elements.

### Usage Guidelines

- Ensure onboarding tooltips do not obstruct other interface elements.
- Use headings only for presentational reasons, provided emphasis is not required for understanding, as emphasis is not provided for screen reader users.
- Use them to highlight new features or assist with user onboarding.

## Toggle Tooltips

Toggle Tooltips ("Toggletips") are compact pieces of information designed to offer additional insights when needed.

- Contain only descriptive text without any formatting.
- Should provide relevant information that may be helpful, but is not required.
- Hidden by default.
- Toggle visibility through user interaction with the information icon.

1. <strong>Trigger</strong>: A compact, circular icon marked with an information
   symbol that activates the toggletip's visibility.
2. <strong>Text</strong>: The main content providing detailed explanation or
   information.
3. <strong>Arrow</strong>: A directional arrow that can point towards any side,
   indicating the source of the information or context.
4. <strong>Container</strong>: The encompassing frame that holds the message
   text and ensures it's distinct from other UI elements.

### Usage Guidelines

- Ensure toggletips do not obstruct other interface elements.
- Use toggletips to provide additional context, provided it is not essential.
