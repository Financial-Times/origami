## Anatomy

<TextInputAnatomy />

1. Title: Clearly indicates that this is a password input field.
2. Text hint: Provides instructions about the password requirements.
3. Input box: The interactive area where users can type their passwords. Characters are masked to ensure privacy.
4. Show password toggle: An option that users can activate to unmask their input.
5. Forgot password: Provides access to the functionality to reset a password.

## Usage Guidelines

### Password Requirements

If there are specific password requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters) display them as hint in the description field.

<PasswordExample brand={props.brand} />

### Validation

Provide clear and specific error message if the password doesn't meet the requirements

<PasswordValidation brand={props.brand} />

<Tip>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Eliminating the confirm password field simplifies the registration
			process, reducing the number of steps and making it quicker and easier for
			users to sign up.
		</li>
		<li>
			Providing a "Show Password" toggle allows users to verify their input
			without retyping it
		</li>
	</ol>
