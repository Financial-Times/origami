Form components are used to collect information and guide users. Here you’ll find general rules for using them that apply to all components. Structure, sequence, and messaging are essential to creating a good user experience.

### Form Componentes

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column">
	<a href="text-input">Text Input</a>
	<a href="text-input">Checkbox</a>
	<a href="text-input">Radio Button</a>
	<a href="text-input">Error summary</a>
</div>


## Placement and Order
When placing form components on a page, there are two basic rules:
1. Always left-align components.
2. Stack components vertically rather than placing them side by side.


<Tip>

A clear top-to-bottom layout aligns with natural reading patterns, ensuring a smoother experience. Avoid placing components horizontally, as it can disrupt the flow and lead to confusion.</Fragment>
