## Anatomy

<CheckboxAnatomy />

1. Label: Indicates the purpose of the checkboxes. It should clearly communicate what kind of choice has to be made.
2. Description: Provides additional context/instructions about the checkbox. It helps users understand what is required or gives examples of the kind of information they should enter.
3. Checkbox container: The checkbox selection control.
4. Checkbox label: Indicates the purpose of the checkbox(es). It should clearly communicate what kind of choice is expected.

## Usage Guidelines

### Selection states

<CheckboxSelectedStates brand={props.brand} />
Checkboxes have three selection states: Unchecked, Checked, and Indeterminate. The
indeterminate state is typically used to indicate a partially selected group of options
or when some but not all sub-options are selected.

### Group Related Checkboxes

<CheckboxGroup brand={props.brand} />
When possible, group related checkboxes together and provide a clear heading or label
to describe the group. This helps users quickly understand what the options are related
to. Avoid putting more than 7 checkboxes in one group.

### Labels

Phrase the labels clearly so that no helper text is needed to clarify what will happen when you select the respective checkbox.

Provide clear and descriptive labels to aid users in understanding the purpose of each checkbox. Use positive, active rather than negative statements, i.e. when the user needs to check the checkbox for something NOT to happen, say:

<Example do title="Provide clear and descriptive labels">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<CheckBox checkboxLabel="Subscribe me to the newsletter" />
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

<Example do={false} title="Don’t use negative statements">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<CheckBox checkboxLabel="Don’t subscribe me to the newsletter" />
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

</BrandedContent>
