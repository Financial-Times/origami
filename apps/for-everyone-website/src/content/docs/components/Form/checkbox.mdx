Checkboxes are used to select one or more items from a list, or turn an item on or off. With checkboxes, we could have multiple options selected at the same time; with toggles that’s not possible. Checkboxes usually don’t take effect right away but the user needs to perform another action to commit the changes using a CTA, like click a submit/Apply button.

## Anatomy

<CheckboxAnatomy asset="anatomy" />

**1. Checkbox container:** The checkbox selection control.

**2. Checkbox icon:** Text that explains the result of selecting the button. Use action verbs or phrases to tell the user what will happen next.

**3. Label:** Text that provide users context. Labels are always presented to the left of the checkbox.

## States

Checkboxes could have various states, based on different parameters such as selection, presence/absence of a label, focus state, error or requirement.

Checkbox have selection states - “Unselected”, “Selected” and “Indeterminate”.

<Checkbox
	props={{
		checkboxLabel: 'Unselected',
	}}
/>

<Checkbox
	props={{
		checkboxLabel: 'Selected',
		attributes: {
			checked: true,
			onChange: () => {},
		},
	}}
/>

<Checkbox
	props={{
		checkboxLabel: 'Indeterminate',
		attributes: {
			indeterminate: true,
		},
	}}
/>

The component can be enabled or disabled. It is not recommended to show disabled components unless user research shows otherwise.

<Checkbox
	props={{
		checkboxLabel: 'Enabled',
	}}
/>

<Checkbox
	props={{
		checkboxLabel: 'Disabled',
		attributes: {
			disabled: true,
		},
	}}
/>
## Behavior

### Touch Area

The minimum clickable/touch area for the checkbox input is at least 44px in order to ensure usability and accessibility on touch devices.

## Usage guidelines

### Best practices

- Checkboxes should be used when we want to indicate a status or a choice.
- We should list them instead of having them side by side in columns.
- Phrase the labels clearly so that no helper text is needed to clarify what will happen when you select the respective checkbox.
- Use checkboxes for up to 7 options.
- Introduce a CTA to finish/commit the changes

### Labels

Provide clear and descriptive labels to aid users in understanding the purpose of each checkbox.
Use positive, active rather than negative statements, i.e.
when the user needs to check the checkbox for something NOT to happen, say:
