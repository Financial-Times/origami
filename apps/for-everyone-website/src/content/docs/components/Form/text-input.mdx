## Anatomy

<TextInputAnatomy />

1. Label: Indicates the purpose of the text input field. It should clearly communicate what kind of information is expected.
2. Description: Provides additional context/instructions about the text input field. It helps users understand what is required or gives examples of the kind of information they should enter.
3. Optional indicator: Indicates fields that are not mandatory.
4. Input box: the interactive area where users can type their input
5. Input text: The text string entered by the user. This is not placeholder text and only applies when the user has typed.
6. Feedback message: provides users with response regarding their input. For now it’s only errors. The feedback message should be clear and specific, guiding the user on any necessary actions
