title: Text Input
description: Checkboxes are used to select one or more items from a list, or turn an item on or off. With checkboxes, we could have multiple options selected at the same time; with toggles that’s not possible. Checkboxes usually don’t take effect right away but the user needs to perform another action to commit the changes using a CTA, like click a submit/Apply button.
