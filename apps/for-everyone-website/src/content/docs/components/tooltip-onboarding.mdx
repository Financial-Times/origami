Onboarding Tooltips help for a smoother introduction to new features or functionality.

- Contain only descriptive unformatted text with an optional title for emphasis.
- Should provide insights or tips that enhance, but aren't critical to, user understanding.
- Appear only once; dismissing them removes them permanently.

## Anatomy

<OnboardingTooltipAnatomy />

1. <strong>Heading (optional)</strong>: Generally, it's best to omit the heading to maintain simplicity and accessibility. Employ a heading only when it's imperative for understanding.
2. <strong>Text</strong>: The main content pro  viding detailed explanation or information.
3. <strong>Close button (Ã—)</strong>: This button dismisses the tooltip. Once closed, the tooltip will not reappear for the user.
4. <strong>Arrow</strong>: A directional arrow that can point towards any side, indicating the source of the information or context.
5. <strong>Container</strong>: The encompassing frame that holds the message text and ensures it's distinct from other UI elements.

## Usage Guidelines

- Ensure they do not obstruct other interface elements.
- Minimize the use of headings to enhance accessibility; reserve them for when absolutely necessary.
- Use them to highlight new features or assist with user onboarding.
