## Primary Palette

These are the FT primary brand colours. They are established colours that make up the FT corporate identity and FT brand. FT pink and FT grey are not used for digital UI, but may be helpful for use alongside FT branded static assets such as the FT logo. For example, FT Pink could be used to prevent a flash of the wrong colour as a logo loads.
