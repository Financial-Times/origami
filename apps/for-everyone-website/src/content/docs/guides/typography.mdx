import TypeScale from '../../../components/TypeScale.astro';

We use a single typographic scale for all fonts. Our scale ranges from -2 to 10. Consider scale 0 the baseline, with ascending and descending values in each direction.

- Our legacy typographic scale uses the same values as our latest scale. See our [legacy Foundations library](https://www.figma.com/file/NtRRxJdOxBO4mM0B3Fxv7M/Ft.com-Foundations?type=design&node-id=3-2&mode=design&t=80a9be0kgkHJdIOa-0) and [legacy o-typography component in Storybook](https://main--655f72ec522e424302dc6201.chromatic.com/).
- Modern Origami introduces the Metric2 font family as a variable font, replacing legacy Metric font files. Metric2 renders larger than Metric for the same font size, therefore you may need to use a smaller scale to align with legacy Metric typography.
- Figma Variables are available for each scale in [your brand's Figma library](https://www.figma.com/files/938480807921629744/team/1237702133754424766).
