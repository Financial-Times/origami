## Origami Image Service

The [Origami Image Service](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/) can be used to resize, format, and optimise images. It also hosts a [number of image sets](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/docs/image-sets) for use in FT digital products, [including FT logos](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/docs/image-sets#FT-Logo).

The quickest way to get started is to experiment with [the URL builder](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/docs/url-builder), and try transforming and optimising some of your images.

## Brand assets

In addition the brand team provide further image assets available to download from [brand.ft.com](https://brand.ft.com/document/91).
