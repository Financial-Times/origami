A set of icons for use across FT Group brands.

- The below is a subset of FT Icons, redesigned to create a cohesive set. See our [new icon Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/cDQZHPJ8e962o9827vugBW/Iconography?type=design&mode=design&t=L6pzL8orfc78JUJo-0) or include CSS Custom Properties for icons via our [o3-foundation](https://origami-for-everyone.ft.com/guides/icons/npmjs.com/package/@financial-times/o3-foundation/) npm package.
- More FT icons are available. See our [legacy Figma UI library](https://www.figma.com/file/MyHQ1qdwYyek5IBdhEEaND/FT-UI-Library?type=design&node-id=0-1498&mode=design&t=uIN7fzq8QDfpjZ4r-0), and [o-icons component](https://o2.origami.ft.com/?path=/story/o2-core_components) for more information.
- The size and weight of our audited iconography has been adjusted to create a cohesive set of icons. Otherwise, they largely align with our legacy set of icons.
