Origami is the FT's design system, used by ft.com and many other products.

<strong>Origami for everyone</strong> is a project to modernise and improve Origami so it scales to satisfy the needs of an increasingly diverse suite of FT products.

In this  section you can read about the motivation behind the project, what it aims to achieve (including non-technical explainers) details of how it's progressing, documentation, demos and resources to help you use both the old version of Origami (o2) and the new (o3). You can also learn more about the Origami for everyone project, such as the product roadmap and non-technical explainers, in the about section.
