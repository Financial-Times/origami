## Origami Vision

The Origami design system enables the discovery, design and build of every user-facing product the FT and its partners deliver.

## Origami Project

Origami is the FT's design system. This includes design guidelines, components, tools, and companion services. With the aim to help teams across the FT design & build digital products for FT brands efficiently and to a high standard.

Today, Origami is used to create ft.com, our apps, as well as internal tools, and increasingly other FT Group brands.

## Origami For Everyone

Origami For Everyone reimagines Origami with a renewed focus on:

1. Design guidelines, to support designers to prototype new products or features consistently, building on tried and tested approaches.
2. Aligned designer and engineering tooling, for improved efficiency and alignment during handover from prototype to build.
3. Multi-brand support, to create a reusable capability across the FT Group and share our product learnings across brands.

## Origami Team

Origami is a collaborative project. Teams across the FT contribute directly to Origami and its success. To help co-ordinate contributions and steer the direction of the project, the core Origami team are on hand to support. If you have questions or feedback about Origami:
