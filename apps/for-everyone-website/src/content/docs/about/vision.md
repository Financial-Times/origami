description: What the Origami for Everyone project aims to achieve
---

The vision of the Origami for Everyone project is:

> The Origami design system enables the discovery, design and build of every user-facing product the FT and its partners deliver.


To deliver on this vision, we have three areas of focus.


### For every discipline
The documentation and implementation of Origami components for engineers is far more complete and of far higher quality than that for designers. We aim to produce resources of a similar high standard for designers, closely coordinated with the engineering tooling. This will make designing and prototyping with Origami easier, improve the discovery process for product managers, and also result in quicker and more accurate handover to engineering.

### For every brand
In Origami making a component look right in a product that uses a different brand is a lot of extra work. Consequently the majority of FT products cannot use Origami. Our goal is that once the work is done to build a component for one brand, then we can extend it with relatively little effort to be usable by products using other brands too.

### For every platform
At present Origami delivers a single implementation of components for use on the web. We want to build out from this foundation to support completely different platforms, such as iOS and android, but also to provide closer integrations with commonly used tools such as React and Figma. This will make user journeys more consistent across FT products and also make building for different platforms quicker and easier.


## Goals

Origami for Everyone will deliver the following benefits.

// Note to self - I like this format, but it doesn't feel like it maps very well to the above or the success metrics, so I think we need to revisit what the project's actual goals are
|Now |Future|
|-|-|
|One fully supported brand| Unlimited brands|
|Web only  |Web, native mobile + other platforms|
|Discovery held up by slow prototyping| User-testable experiments in hours|
|Inconsistent, untidy UIs|  Premium look and feel everywhere|
|Weeks to ship a new UI|  Days to ship|
