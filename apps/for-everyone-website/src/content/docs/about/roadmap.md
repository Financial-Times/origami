title: Roadmap
description: What we're doing now, next and further into the future.
---

Some form of documentation, not user stories, not even what worked on when... it's about outputs and outcomes: "What am I getting when?"
- Make it incremental
  - e.g. when getting first draft, first batch, when beta gonna be in production
- Milestones
- Why are we doing it - what's the benefit
- due date
- on track
- progress (not started etc)
- Link product roadmap to epics


- Organise around the big flaws we are seeking to address


- Make it clear how to get something on the roadmap.. link to 'work with us'
