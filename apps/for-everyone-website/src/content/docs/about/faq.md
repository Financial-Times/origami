        What is Origami – o2?
    </summary>
    "o2" refers to our legacy components, these are widely used and will be maintained for the foreseeable future as we gradually move to new "o3" components and patterns. "o2" components lack meaningful design guidelines and design tools. We recommend designers use Storybook to explore what components are available and what variants they support.

        Can I use o3 guidelines / components / patterns today?
    </summary>
    Absolutely! We'd love you to. Teams across the FT Group have begun to use "o3" in production. Please reach out to the Origami team (<a href="https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/origami-support">#origami-support</a>), so we can support you through early adoption as we refine "o3" and improve our documentation.

        What is Origami For Everyone?
    </summary>
    Origami For Everyone referred to our proposal to reimagine Origami with a renewed focus on design guidelines; aligned designer and engineering tooling; and enhanced multi-brand support. As we begin to realise that vision with "o3" components and patterns, we no longer need to refer to Origami For Everyone.
