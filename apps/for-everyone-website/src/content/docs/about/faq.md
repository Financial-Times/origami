        What is o2/o3?
    </summary>
    "o2" refers to our legacy components, these are widely used and will be maintained for the foreseeable future. "o3" refers to our new components, built from the ground up with new design guidelines, aligned designer and engineering tooling, and improved multi-brand support. Going forward we are moving away from o2/o3 language in favour of legacy/new Origami.

        Can I use new guidelines / components / patterns?
    </summary>
    Absolutely! We'd love you to. Please reach out to to Origami team (<a href="https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/origami-support">#origami-support</a>), so we can support you through early adoption. We expect adoption to pick up more freely in Q2, after we have published Origami's <a href="https://www.figma.com/files/938480807921629744/team/1237702133754424766">new figma libraries</a> and improved technical documentation for our new components.
