Pagination aids user movement across an ordered collection of items that has been split into pages.

- We provide infinite scrolling guidelines, as an acceptable alternative for some usecases.
- Our pagination pattern shows a variable number of pages to accommodate mobile and desktop experiences.
- This pattern is available via [your brands Figma library](https://www.figma.com/files/938480807921629744/team/1237702133754424766) and our [o3-button](https://origami-for-everyone.ft.com/guides/icons/npmjs.com/package/@financial-times/o3-button/) npm package.
- A similar legacy pagination pattern exists within our [legacy o-buttons component](https://o2.origami.ft.com/?path=/story/o2-core_components-o-buttons--pagination). However, this legacy pattern does not support a mobile experience. It also is not represented in our legacy Figma UI Library.

## Anatomy

<PaginationAnatomy />

- **Navigation (1, 5)**: Previous and next buttons to navigate relatively from the currently selected page.
- **Page (2,3)**: Numbers that indicate pages.
- **Truncation (4)**: Indicated by ellipses (â€¦) to replace any skipped pages.

## Usage Guidelines

### Standard pagination

We recommend using our standard pagination pattern, which is available within [your brands Figma library](https://www.figma.com/files/938480807921629744/team/1237702133754424766) and our [o3-button](https://origami-for-everyone.ft.com/guides/icons/npmjs.com/package/@financial-times/o3-button/) npm package. This:

- Should be placed at the bottom of a long list that has been split up into pages.
- Should navigate to the previous and next set of items in the paged list.
- Indicate when users are at the first or the last page by disabling the arrows.

<Example title="Choose pagination when" do={true}>
	- A list has a significant number of items, typically more than 25. - When
	showing all the content on a single page makes the page take too long to load.
</Example>

#### When all pages can be displayed

Our pagination pattern supports 4 pages on small viewports, such as mobile devices, and 7 pages on larger desktop viewports. When there are more than 7 pages, we hide pages behind an ellipsis.

<Example>
	<ButtonPagination
		previousPager={{label: 'previous', href: '#previous'}}
		nextPager={{label: 'next', href: '#next'}}
		pages={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].map(p => ({
			href: `#${p}`,
			current: p === 2,
			number: p,
		}))}
	/>
</Example>

#### When the selected page is one of the first 2 pages

Show the first 3 pages; ellipsis; and the last 1 or 3 pages, as space allows.

<Example>
	<ButtonPagination
		previousPager={{label: 'previous', href: '#previous'}}
		nextPager={{label: 'next', href: '#next'}}
		pages={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].map(p => ({
			href: `#${p}`,
			current: p === 2,
			number: p,
		}))}
	/>
</Example>

#### When the selected page is one of the last 2 pages

Show the first page, or first 3 where space allows; ellipsis; and the last 3 pages.

<Example>
	<ButtonPagination
		previousPager={{label: 'previous', href: '#previous'}}
		nextPager={{label: 'next', href: '#next'}}
		pages={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].map(p => ({
			href: `#${p}`,
			current: p === 9,
			number: p,
		}))}
	/>
</Example>

#### When the 3rd page is selected

Show the first 3 pages, or 4 pages where space allows; the ellipsis; and 1 or 2 more pages, as space allows.

<Example>
	<ButtonPagination
		previousPager={{label: 'previous', href: '#previous'}}
		nextPager={{label: 'next', href: '#next'}}
		pages={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].map(p => ({
			href: `#${p}`,
			current: p === 3,
			number: p,
		}))}
	/>
</Example>

#### When the selected page is the 3rd from the last page

Show the first page, or first 2 pages where space allows; the ellipsis; and 3 or 4 last pages, as space allows.

<Example>
	<ButtonPagination
		previousPager={{label: 'previous', href: '#previous'}}
		nextPager={{label: 'next', href: '#next'}}
		pages={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].map(p => ({
			href: `#${p}`,
			current: p === 8,
			number: p,
		}))}
	/>
</Example>

#### When the selected page is over 3 from the first and last page

Show the first page; ellipsis; the selected page, with 1 page either side if space allows; another ellipsis; and the last page.

<Example>
	<ButtonPagination
		previousPager={{label: 'previous', href: '#previous'}}
		nextPager={{label: 'next', href: '#next'}}
		pages={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].map(p => ({
			href: `#${p}`,
			current: p === 5,
			number: p,
		}))}
	/>
</Example>

### Infinite scroll

There are some cases when infinite scroll is appropriate. This is a common pattern within our iOS and Android apps. Origami does not currently provide a full pattern for this, however we recommend the following:

- Where infinite scrolling is used, start loading items when merchants are close to the bottom, roughly 5 items from the end.
- Show our [legacy loading indicator](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-loading@5.2.2) below the list to indicate that items have been requested.
- After more results have been fetched, they should load in below.

<Example title="Choose infinite scroll when" do={true}>
	- You're working on a native application, with an established pattern.
</Example>

<Example title="Avoid infinite scroll when" do={false}>
	- You're working on the web, where it is not an established pattern for us,
	unless user research shows they improve your interface. - It interferes with
	access to content below, such as our footer. - Where returning to or sharing a
	given pages is helpful.
</Example>

## Themes

Our pagination pattern supports all button themes. For example:

### Standard Pagination

<Preview theme="standard" />
### Inverse Pagination

<div data-o3-theme="inverse">
	<Preview theme="inverse" />
</div>
