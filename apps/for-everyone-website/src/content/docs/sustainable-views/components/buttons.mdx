Buttons are triggers that provide users with a call to action. Typically allowing users to execute, choose, submit and confirm actions.

## Anatomy

The button component contains two required elements and one optional element.

<ButtonAnatomy />

1. <strong>Icon (optional)</strong>: Most buttons don't need an icon. Use an
   icon to add additional affordance where the icon has a clear and
   well-established meaning.
1. <strong>Label</strong>: Text that explains the result of selecting the
   button. Use action verbs or phrases to tell the user what will happen next.
1. <strong>Container</strong>: has minimum width of 80px for standard buttons
   and 64px for small buttons.

## Icons

Buttons may be used with icons, without icons, or only icons.

### Without icon

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'inverse'}}
/>

### With icon

When icons are used, these are always left aligned.

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{
		label: 'Hello',
		type: 'primary',
		theme: 'inverse',
		icon: 'search',
	}}
/>

### Only icon

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{
		label: 'Hello',
		type: 'primary',
		theme: 'inverse',
		icon: 'search',
		iconOnly: true,
	}}
/>

## Sizes

The button comes in two sizes: standard and small.

### Standard

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'inverse'}}
/>

### Small

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{
		label: 'Hello',
		type: 'primary',
		theme: 'inverse',
		size: 'small',
	}}
/>

## Types

There are three types of buttons to support different contexts.

### Primary

The primary button is used for the most important calls to action on a page. Primary buttons should only appear once per product area (not including the application header, modal dialogue, on-site messaging, or side panel).

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'inverse'}}
/>

### Secondary

For secondary actions on each page or used in conjunction with a primary button. As part of a pair, the secondary button’s function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel” or “Back”.

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'secondary', theme: 'inverse'}}
/>

### Ghost

For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button. In a situation such as a progress flow, a ghost button may be paired with a primary and secondary button set, where the primary button is for ‘Save and continue’ the ghost button would be ‘Skip’.

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'ghost', theme: 'inverse'}}
/>

## Themes

Each button type supports the following themes.

### Standard

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

### Inverse

An alternative theme for use on dark backgrounds.

<Preview
	brand="sustainable-views"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'inverse'}}
/>
