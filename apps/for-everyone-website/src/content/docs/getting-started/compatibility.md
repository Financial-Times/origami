## Core & enhanced experiences

`core` and `enhanced` are definitions we have for 'experiences' that we serve to a browser. The experience we serve depends on the presence of some features within the browser.

Generally, older browsers that don't support newer JavaScript features will get a `core` experience, and modern browsers will get the `enhanced` experience.

Origami components contain fallback styling for the browsers that fail to load JavaScript. Weâ€™ll always assume that the experience we will be served is core, until proven otherwise.

## Browser support
