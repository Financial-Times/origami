import {LinkButton} from '@financial-times/o3-button';

This technical guide covers Origami "o3", the [latest evolution of Origami](/about/what-is-new/). If you are working with older Origami components, which are still most commonly in use today, we have a separate ["o2" technical guide](/o2-components/technical-guide/).

## User guide

We publish multiple Origami packages to npm which are independently versioned and contain a collection of reusable components and patterns.

If you would like to get started quickly, continue to our [guide to using Origami via npm](/getting-started/technical-guide/package-manager-npm). Otherwise keep reading for a general technical overview of Origami components.
