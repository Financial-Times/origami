Origami is a collaborative project by and for the FT which includes components, guidelines, tools, and services to help design & build digital products for FT brands.

Our getting started guide aims to take you through the basics of Origami use to design and engineer products for the FT. If you have any problems, questions, or feedback please [reach out to the core Origami team](/getting-started/support/). There are no silly questions, as a services team we're here to help.

## o2 vs. o3

Origami is growing and becoming more useful. For now, you'll find most projects use Origami v2 ("o2"). Others have begun to upgrade to Origami v3 ("o3").

Whilst we migrate projects it's useful for most people to understand both Origami "o2" and Origami "o3". See our [what's new guide](/about/what-is-new/) to understand the key differences and benefits of "o3", which cover design tooling, technology choices, and workflows.

The following will be an introduction to the latest from Origami, "o3". If you need to work with Origami "o2", please refer to the ["o2" technical guide](/o2-components/technical-guide/) and the ["o2" Figma guide](/o2-components/design-guide/).

## Design

If you work in design, we recommend starting with our [design guide](/getting-started/design-guide/). This will get you up and running with Origami's Figma libraries. We'll cover how to design for translation to code, for yourself or effective collaboration with engineers.

## Code

If you're writing code, we have a [technical guide](/getting-started/technical-guide/) as a starting point. Even if you don't design, you may want to review our [design guide also](/getting-started/design-guide/). This will help you understand what you should expect when working with designers, for optimal collaboration with your peers.
