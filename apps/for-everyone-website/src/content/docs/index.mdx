## Product Delivery Superpowers

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Validate ideas" icon="pencil">
		A fully featured Figma library of all our components, with thorough documentation for patterns and design guidelines.
		Mock-up prototypes quickly, saving time to focus on where you can add unique value.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Rollout to production" icon="add-document">
		Designers ❤️ engineers. New Figma and Origami integrations allow a designer to see a live, interactive component preview instantly. Integrations with Figma's Dev Mode mean a much smoother handover process, with fewer mistakes, and less back-and-fourth.
	</Card>
	<Card title="No more waiting" icon="setting">
		No more Sass, or accidental Doom Scrolling from engineers as they wait for it to compile. Build times for Origami For Everyone are significantly reduced allowing engineers to quickly see the affect of their change and iterate.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Next level collaboration" icon="open-book">
		Origami For Everyone improves support for brand and platform variations. We're working with the Specialist team to introduce a new brand, so we can collaborate together on shared components across groups.
