### Width

A button's width is dependant on the length of its content by default. Alternatively buttons may be "fluid", and stretch to fill the full width of their container.

Use fluid buttons for smaller devices or containers e.g on mobile web or the app. We recommend buttons are fluid until around 400px, after which the button should be determined by the length of its content.

_(Resize your browser to preview the fluid button's responsive width)_

<Preview
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Fluid button', type: 'primary', fluid: true}}
/>
