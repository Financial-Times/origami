<Guideline summary="Limit the number of buttons in a group" do={false}>
	<p slot="description">
		Never use groups of more than six buttons, as too many calls to action can
		cause users to be unsure of what to do next. Also be thoughtful about how
		multiple buttons will look and work on small screens, this may vary
		according the the length of the button's label.
