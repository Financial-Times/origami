# Origami 3

Origami 3 is an experimental collection of Origami components built with a new stack. We would appreciate any [feedback](#feedback-and-support) you have to help drive out the future of Origami.

Origami 2 is still the main stable release of Origami. You can find the [documentation for Origami 2](https://origami.ft.com/) on our website.

## What's new?

### No more Sass

Origami 3 components are designed to have no dependency on Sass and instead are built with CSS. This means that you can now use Origami in any web project without needing to build with Sass.

### Branding through CSS custom properties

Core, Internal, and Whitelabel branding has been implemented through the use of CSS custom properties and design tokens. This means that you can now easily change the branding of Origami components without needing to rebuild them through the use of the CSS cascade. Introducing new brands is also seamless.

### TSX implementations

Along with usage through plain HTML, Origami 3 comes with TSX implementations of components. This means that you can now use Origami components in React, Vue, and other frameworks.

## How to use

### Web Projcts

Origami 3 components are published to npm under the `@financial-times` scope, and are prefixed with `o3`. For example, to install button:

```bash
npm install --save @financial-times/o3-button
```

As SASS is no longer required, Origami 3 components can be used in any web project that targets HTML and CSS. TSX implementations of components are also available for use in React, Vue, and other frameworks.

### Figma

Each component has an equivalent Figma component, each story has a link to the Figma component in the description.

#### Structure

Origami 3 components have a Figma project for each brand. This can be found in the [Origami for Everyone](https://www.figma.com/files/938480807921629744/team/1237702133754424766) group on Figma.
