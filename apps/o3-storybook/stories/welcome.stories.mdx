# Origami 3

Origami 3 is an experimental collection of Origami components built with a new stack. We would appreciate any [feedback](#feedback-and-support) you have to help drive out the future of Origami.

Origami 2 is still the main stable release of Origami. You can find the documentation for Origami 2 [here](https://origami.ft.com/).

## What's new?

### No more SASS

Origami 3 components are designed to have no dependency on SASS and instead are built with CSS. This means that you can now use Origami in any web project without needing to build with SASS.

### Branding through CSS custom properties

Core, Internal, and Whitelabel branding has been implemented through the use of CSS custom properties and design tokens. This means that you can now easily change the branding of Origami components without needing to rebuild them through the use of the CSS cascade. Introducing new brands is also seamless.

### TSX implementations

Along with usage through plain HTML, Origami 3 comes with TSX implementations of components. This means that you can now use Origami components in React, Vue, and other frameworks.

## Feedback and Support

As we continue to grow Origami 3, we would love to hear your feedback to help shape the future of Origami. Please get in touch through our Slack channel #origami-support.
