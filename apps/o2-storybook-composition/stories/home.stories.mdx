# Legacy Origami

This Storybook includes documentation and demos for legacy "o2" Origami components. These are still actively used and will continue to be supported by the Origami team until further notice. However, for new projects or features, we recommend using our [new Origami components](https://origami-for-everyone.ft.com). These have been rethought from the ground up, with aligned Figma libraries, design guidelines, and brand support powered by design tokens.

To learn more about the future of Origami component documentation, see our [January 2024 newsletter](https://origami.ft.com/blog/2024/02/12/newsletter/).

Please contact the Origami team in the [#origami-support](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/origami-support) Slack channel for support or to share feedback.
