# Origami 2 (o2)

This Storybook includes documentation and demos for Origami 2 “o2” packages. These include foundational styles, components, and patterns. These will be gradually deprecated over time, as we conduct design audits and build Origami 3 “o3” alternatives. Where components are deprecated, [begin to use the o3 alternative](https://origami-beta.ft.com/o2-components/).

Please contact the Origami team in the [#origami-support](https://financialtimes.slack.com/messages/origami-support) Slack channel for support or to share feedback.
