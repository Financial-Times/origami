The Origami Navigation Service is a JSON API which provides navigation structures for use across FT websites. Using the service keeps your site consistent and reduces the need for you to manage link updates.

This service is freely available to users within the Financial Times **only**. Use by a party outside of the Financial Times may be blocked without warning.

To start using the Navigation Service, please <a href="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/navigation" class="o-typography-link--external">refer to the service documentation</a>.
