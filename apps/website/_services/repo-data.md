title: Repo Data
---


Origami Repo Data is an API which can be used to get information about repositories which contain an `origami.json` file. These could be components, services, image sets, and Node.js modules. Inclusion in this API does not mean a module is supported by the Origami team, and it is mostly for use by members of the Origami team, and requires an API key to use.

To start using Repo Data, please <a href="https://origami-repo-data.ft.com/" class="o-typography-link--external">refer to the service documentation</a>.
