<!-- TL;DR -->
{% capture text %}This issue features the new Origami website with a new design and new documentation; a highlight of the improved service that the Polyfill Service provides; and an explanation of how ECMAScript Modules broke our components.

<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Origami Website Launch" %}
{% capture text %}This month we've successfully launched the <a href="https://origami.ft.com/" target="_blank">new Origami website</a>. It is officially out of beta, and implements all of the <a href="https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-layout?brand=internal" target="_blank">new features of o-layout</a>, which has unified the design across our documentation and our registry. In addition to the visual changes, this launch is packed full of new documentation and a more digestible spec. You can find more detailed information about the launch in <a href="https://origami.ft.com/blog/2019/03/11/site-update">this blog post</a>. As always, we welcome any feedback or questions you might have about the new website's content and UI.
{% endcapture %}
{% include email/paragraph.html content=text %}

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Polyfills served" %}
{% capture text %}Three years ago, the <a href="https://polyfill.io" target="_blank">Polyfill Service</a> served 400 million polyfills per month. Today, it serves <strong>800 million</strong> <em>every day</em> ðŸ’ª.
{% endcapture %}
{% include email/paragraph.html content=text %}

<!-- Thing 3 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="ECMAScript Modules vs CommonJS" %}
{% capture text %}We attempted to replace CommonJS with ECMAScript Modules across some of our components to align them more closely to the standard of JavaScript that is used in web browsers (ECMAScript Modules). The intention wass to get to a place where teams would not need to compile Origami components' JavaScript in order to use it. This shift caused a breaking change as it brought about client-side JavaScript errors for some projects and users. We have since reverted those changes and are working on a different approach. If there is anything that we might have missed or any questions you might have, please get in touch with the team.
