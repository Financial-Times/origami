<!-- TL;DR -->
{% capture text %} Featuring FT Professional updates; front-end technology
tooling maps; TSX templates and Storybook demos; and the bit where we failed to
deliver around 9k image requests each day due to a confusing and unprompted
error, affecting pretty much every FT Group product. {% endcapture %} {% include

<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="FT Professional" %} {% capture text %} We're
getting ready to support the rollout of FT Professional's rebrand! This month
Origami has been working with FT Professional to gather requirements and
identify which Origami components require a new professional theme, ahead of a
Q2 rollout.

As part of that work Thomas Moody has been designing Professional
themed Origami components and adding them to our shared Figma UI Kit ‚Äì this
allows designers to pull reusable components into a design, rather than have to
design everything from scratch all the time. We partnered on button updates
(these are surprisingly complex, with many states) and made a bunch of other
improvements at the same time.

<details>
	<summary>Latest o-buttons updates to our Figma UI Kit.</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>
			We replaced the boolean "Primary" variant with a "Type" variant which can
			be ‚ÄúPrimary‚Äù, ‚ÄúSecondary‚Äù, or ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù button types. This aligns design
			tooling with the Origami component engineers pull into production
			applications.
		</li>
		<li>
			We deleted the separate ghost button Figma component, now that we can
			switch the type of button as above.
		</li>
		<li>
			We deleted a ‚Äúcustom‚Äù theme. It's possible to use o-buttons to generate
			buttons for a custom colour, but what was this specific example in design
			tooling for? We don‚Äôt want to encourage use of that particular theme do
			we..?
		</li>
		<li>
			We fixed the inverse focus state of buttons so designs more accurately
			reflect what an engineer will produce with Origami's o-buttons component.
		</li>
	</ul>
</details>

It was fun pairing with Tom on that and picking up a few more Figma tricks as an
engineer: designers and engineers unite! These changes are aimed at increasing
design team efficiency and improving designer/engineer hand over by aligning our
design tooling and implementation. We have a lot more to do here, as many
components are missing or difficult to work with design side. An engineer can't
engineer with a re-usable capability if we don't design with them in mind. {%

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Technology Tooling Maps" %} {% capture text %}
Origami as a project started over 9 years ago. We've come a long way since then
with all sorts of new components, tools, and services. Yet the technologies we
use within Origami components themselves have stayed largely the same. This kind
of adaptable stability is, I think, pretty remarkable and to be celebrated.

However the technology landscape within and outside the FT has changed
substantially. Front-end frameworks are mature, we no longer need to support
IE11, and there's a whole ecosystem around design systems which didn't exist
before. What opportunities are we missing to help the FT scale? Wouldn't it be
great if a designer could move from Internal to Specialist teams, or vice-versa,
and get up and running quickly with a familiar suite of tools; if a designer in
Professional could select a portion of their ft.com design and apply the
Professional sub-brand with a click? If they could hand over to an engineer who
could see at a glance which re-usable component to pull in, and what options to
apply, instead of asking in a back-and-forth conversation or scrabbling around
documentation for a few hours? Finally, what if the developer experience for the
most used, most recommended technology choices at the FT were prioritised ‚Äì no
more figuring out how to integrate an Origami component with [insert framework
of choice] for the 100th time?

Having a thorough understanding of the technology
landscape at the FT will help us make technical decisions to achieve such
things. Of course, we have our reckons ‚Äì¬†our assumptions ‚Äì but we'll also be
reaching out to teams to ask. We would be super grateful for your time. We'll be
looking to put together a front-end technology tooling map which can answer:

- What tools and techniques FT Group engineers use today.
- Any plans teams have to migrate to new technologies in the near future.
- What tools and techniques teams would be keen to explore.

We'll use this to make decisions about how we author Origami components in the future ‚Äì expect a Request For Comment üòä

<!-- Thing 3 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="TSX templates and Storybook demos" %} {%
capture text %} As you may know, the Origami team has been working on
re-creating [Origami component](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components)
demos in [Storybook](https://origami.ft.com/storybook/). We've been working at
it slowly around competing priorities for forever, having first started talking
about Storybook in a [Nov 2021 blog
post](https://origami.ft.com/blog/2021/11/05/newsletter/) ‚Äì it's been a
turbulent time for the team during this period, having lost and regained
headcount, which slowed down projects outside Business As Usual (BAU)
significantly. This isn't a moan, it's an excuse.

Anyhow, now we're a healthier
team again at 3 engineers, we're still trying to do too much. We've decided not
to work on any more Storybook or TSX templates during Q2 ‚Äì though we will come
back to it, eventually, else maintain multiple systems which make up our custom
component registry forever.

For now, our focus will be on supporting the rollout
of the new FT Professional sub-brand (excited eek!) and working on a technical
architecture proposal for modern Origami components (amazed and curious
oooooohhh!) ‚Äì so we can much more effectively scale to support new brands and
sub-brands in the future and better support collaboration across groups.

We've created Storybook demos and TSX templates for 26 of our components which need
them ‚Äì most recently this month, o-table üéâ There are 14 left which we'd like to
do, tracked in Epic [OR-15](https://financialtimes.atlassian.net/browse/OR-15)
now [we're on Jira](https://origami.ft.com/blog/2023/03/03/newsletter/#jira). If
you're keen to have a particular interactive demo in Storybook which isn't
already there, or you would benefit immediately from a TSX template rather than
copy-pasting and noodling around with HTML attributes, let us know and we'll get
that prioritised especially for you ‚ù§Ô∏è One off pull requests, bootcamps, and
secondments are also very welcome!{% endcapture %} {% include
email/markdown.html content=text %}

<!-- Special thanks -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Special Thanks" %} {% capture text %}Speaking
of BAU. The Origami Image Service surprise <strike>exploded</strike> experienced
a technical malfunction this month, resulting in many thousands of errors
(around 9k over 24 hours), with each error representing a failure to deliver a
requested image to a reader ‚Äì impacting pretty much every FT Group product that
displays images. We hadn't made any changes and struggled to identify a cause.
Thankfully, a bunch of excellent people across the FT offered to help. It's a
path which lead me to a conversation about
[ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) ‚Äì way out of my comfort zone, I
thought I was a humble, front-end focused engineer.

Anyhow, that's all resolved
now so don't fear, reader! We mitigated the issue reasonably swiftly and
subsequently found a fix ‚Äì there's an [incident summary in
Slack](https://financialtimes.slack.com/archives/C04S3UGD8HL/p1678452906995959)
and a [PR with technical
details](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-image-service/pull/826) if
you're interested.

My point is, what a wonderful, supportive culture we have
here at the FT. A huge special thanks this month goes to everyone who took time
out of their day to help in the [#engineering
channel](https://financialtimes.slack.com/archives/C03TWD9G1/p1677843126578639),
the [incident
channel](https://financialtimes.slack.com/archives/CKULLGWQ1/p1677863674600469),
and in subsequent pairing over video call. I want to give a particular shout out
to Alex Muller üôá and Rowan Manning üôá, if it wasn't for the time we spent
pairing I'm sure it would have taken much longer to get to a proper
resolution.{% endcapture %} {% include email/markdown.html content=text %}

<!-- Broader update -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Broader update" %} {% capture text %}A digest
list of some other things that have happened in March:{% endcapture %} {%
include email/markdown.html content=text %} {% capture text %}- NEW
[o-multi-select](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-multi-select@1.0.0):
As promised in our [previous newsletter for
February](https://origami.ft.com/blog/2023/03/03/newsletter/#new-component--o-multi-select),
we have released a new new component, o-multi-select! Thanks Will Renny for your
proposal and design work on that, we're looking forward to seeing this rollout
in Spark first üëè Note that we‚Äôve released this component experimentally for now
as we await an accessibility review by a Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)
representative, but we‚Äôve done our own research and you should feel free to use
now ‚Äì with the caveat that we may need to make changes depending on DAC‚Äôs
feedback. - MAJOR
[ft-date-format](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/ft-date-format@3.0.0/readme):
Introduces `t` symbol support for formatting for time following FT's Editorial
style. - MAJOR
[o-date](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-date@6.0.0): Introduces
the latest version of `ft-date-format` to support formatting time following FT's
Editorial style. To upgrade see the [o-date migration
guide](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami/blob/main/components/o-date/MIGRATION.md#migrating-from-v5-to-v6)
‚Äì nice one, Chee Rabbits and Leigh-Ann Gant! - MAJOR
[o-topper](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-topper@6.0.3): o-topper
no longer includes JavaScript to select the correct topper for JSON-formatted FT
articles and flags. This helper was deeply tied to the FT.com content store, and
included hardcoded UUIDs and business logic beyond the scope of Origami. Origami
components focus on providing reusable user interfaces ‚Äì without business logic
assumptions which could limit their use outside specific groups or use-cases.
Juan Sanchez and the StoryTelling team have also since updated the Deep Portrait
topper style for improved readability üéâ To upgrade see [o-topper migration
guide](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami/blob/main/components/o-topper/MIGRATION.md#migrating-from-v5-to-v6).
- MINOR [o-forms](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-forms@9.7.0):
Adds a `GenericInput` TSX template, to use custom form inputs within an o-forms
field ‚Äì which includes label and related layout styles. - MINOR
[o-table](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-table@9.3.0): As
mentioned, o-table includes TSX templates and [interactive Storybook
demos](https://origami.ft.com/storybook/brands/core/?path=/story/components-o-table-responsive--table-with-responsive-scroll).
- MINOR
[github-label-sync](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/github-label-sync@2.3.1/readme)
we accepted a couple of [Open Source
contributions](https://github.com/Financial-Times/github-label-sync/releases)
for github-label-sync this month. These improve Github label name and
description validation as well as add an optional "delete" flag which allows
managed Github labels to be deleted. - MINOR
[o-icons](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-icons@7.6.0): adds a new
preferences (/filter) icon, another shout out to Thomas Moody for that
contribution üî• - PATCH
[o-typography](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-typography@7.3.5):
o-typography links which open in a new window/tab no longer cause unwanted
overflow, [this was a fun problem which caused a whole bunch of excess
whitespace](https://financialtimes.slack.com/archives/CSH1XFM5W/p1678978026106699)
at the bottom of our "FT 1000: the seventh annual ranking of Europe‚Äôs
fastest-growing companies". Hey Storytelling! When you have time, pull in the
latest version of o-typography to fix that ‚ò∫Ô∏è - PATCH
[o-teaser](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-teaser@6.2.6): Nothing
much, just uses the latest version of o-date in its demos. {% endcapture %} {%
