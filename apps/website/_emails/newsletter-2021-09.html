<!-- TL;DR -->
{% capture text %} We made a monorepo, and gained a delivery manager {%
endcapture %} {% include email/tldr.html content=text %}

<!-- Top things -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Top Things" %} {% capture text %}Some of the
bigger Origami news from the last month:{% endcapture %} {% include
email/markdown.html content=text %}

<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="The Origami Component System" %} {% capture
text %} The biggest thing we've done this month is move all of our components
into a single repository. Each component used to live in a separate code base,
and that meant a lot of extra work when we want to make changes that affected
more than one component. This work doesn't change a lot by itself beyond how we
work on components, but it is the foundation from which we'll build a better
component system. #### How does this affect me? How this change affects you
depends on how you interact with Origami ##### Origami contributors If you want
to open an issue or a pull request on an Origami component, you should do it in
the [Origami Component System
repository](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami). The testing in CI is so
fast now, any change runs the test on every single component and for most
changes it finishes in about 2 minutes. Everything else should be about the
same. Documentation is a little light at the moment, but if you run into any
trouble you can always talk to us in #origami-support or #origami-chat on Slack.
##### Origami consumers This work itself doesn't affect end-users of Origami,
but later changes it unlocks (design tokens, better documentation, sass modules)
will make your life better, I promise. ##### Designers This change won't affect
you yet, but the work we're going to build on top of this will give you better
insight into how a change to one component affects the others. And it's the
first step to Origami being the reference implementation of the design system.
##### Everyone else The sites that depend on Origami have a bright future of
performing better and being more accessible. {% endcapture %} {% include

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Origami has a new team member" %} {% capture
text %} Since we last spoke, the team has grown! We're very happy to welcome
aboard Kamran Muniree who is now serving as Origami's delivery manager. He's
already made a big difference, and the team are very excited about the future.
We're also still hiring for an engineering role, so make sure you apply if
you've ever wanted to work on Origami. There has never been a better time to be
part of the team. {% endcapture %} {% include email/markdown.html content=text

<!-- Thing 3 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Origami Office Hours" %} {% capture text %}
This isn't new, but every week on a Friday at 2p.m. (London time) the team are
available On-Line at a meeting called [Origami Office
Hours](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MWVzZDgzMmhtcXZhYTVvNmlyZXZyNm5tNjdfMjAyMTEwMDhUMTMwMDAwWiBjaGVlLnJhYmJpdHNAZnQuY29t&tmsrc=chee.rabbits%40ft.com&scp=ALL).
If you ever have any questions that you'd prefer talking through in person, you
can pop by there and we'll be available. Thanks to Kamran Muniree it is now
available in the P&T calendar. {% endcapture %} {% include email/markdown.html
