<!-- Preamble (just for the first newsletter) -->
{% capture text %}
	Welcome to the first issue of the Origami Newsletter!
	We'll be sending out an email like this at the end of each month,
	keeping people in Product and Technology up-to-date with what we're working on.

<!-- TL;DR -->
{% capture text %}
	This issue features a new component named o-stepped-progress,
	for tracking user progress through a multi-step process;
	a new beta for o-header-services,
	including new features and a lot of code improvements;
	and the release of the Polyfill Service v3,
	which is faster and more maintainable than ever before.

<!-- Top 3 things -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Top three things" %}

{% capture text %}These are some of the bigger things we've worked on or released over the last month.{% endcapture %}
{% include email/paragraph.html content=text %}

<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="New component: o-stepped-progress" %}
{% capture text %}
	We released the first stable version of o-stepped-progress.
	This new component is used to help a user track progress through
	a multi-step process, such as a form. This was developed to be used
	as part of the signup process on FT.com as well as contract checkpoints
	on Lodestar. Thanks to Lucinda Vieira-Martins and Olga Shevchenko
	for their excellent designs. You can view
	<a href="https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-stepped-progress" target="_blank">demos for this component in the Origami registry</a>.
{% endcapture %}
{% include email/paragraph.html content=text %}

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="New beta: o-header-services" %}
{% capture text %}
	o-header-services is a component used by many of our internal products
	and tools to aid navigation. We've been adding features and making some
	changes recently which are now available as a beta. Some highlights:
	reimplementing a drawer that doesn't rely on code from the FT.com header,
	the option to use dropdowns, and generally improved accessibility.
	As always, we appreciate feedback if you have it! More detail on what's
	changed is available on the <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-header-services/pull/51" target="_blank">v3 pull request here</a>.
{% endcapture %}
{% include email/paragraph.html content=text %}

<!-- Thing 3 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="New major version: Polyfill Service v3" %}
{% capture text %}
	We launched v3 of the Polyfill service, which was outlined in a separate
	launch email. This release includes better polyfills, a faster service,
	and a more maintainable codebase.
	There's a <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#migrating-from-v2-to-v3" target="_blank">migration guide here</a>,
	or check out the live service at <a href="https://polyfill.io/v3/" target="_blank">polyfill.io</a>.

<!-- Special thanks -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Special thanks" %}

{% capture text %}
	This monthâ€™s special thanks goes to Chee Rabbits, who has been
	helping the team to make Origami components available on npm.
	Theyâ€™ve been a lot of fun to work with, and have persevered time
	and time again with some very complicated technical problems.
	Thanks Chee ðŸ˜Š
