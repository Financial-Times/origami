<!-- TL;DR -->
{% capture text %}
This issue features a tutorial to create a new Origami component, automated "readme" documentation review, and new
"indicator" labels.

<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Create A New Origami Component" %}
{% capture text %}

This month we released a new tutorial, [Create A New Origami
Component](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-1/). The tutorial starts from an empty
folder and concludes by publishing a new component to the [Origami
registry](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components).

Our aim was to encourage more contributions from outside the core Origami team by pulling together documentation from
various sources into a complete step-by-step guide. We hope the tutorial will be useful for teams who want to create new
Origami components, such as when the former Comments team built
[o-comments](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-comments@7.6.5); and for new or guest members of the Origami
team, such as when Olga Averjanova created the
[o-meter](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-meter@2.0.4?brand=internal) component during their bootcamp with
us.

The tutorial is comprehensive and covers topics which may not be relevant to all components. In the future we would like
to reduce the length of the tutorial by splitting out topics into separate tutorials.

If you are interested in creating a component please take a look. We are available in the
[#origami-support](https://app.slack.com/client/T025C95MN/C02FU5ARJ) Slack channel to help if you get stuck, and as
always welcome feedback or suggestions on all things Origami in the
[#origami-chat](https://app.slack.com/client/T025C95MN/CSW6B2VAN) Slack channel ðŸ˜€

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Automated Readme Review" %} {% capture text %}
Another change we've made to help Origami contributors and Origami users is to verify README documentation of a
component. The latest version of [Origami Build Tools](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-build-tools) checks
for:
- A title which matches the component name.
- A short description of the component.
- A table of contents with matching heading levels.
- A licence.

Any issues are also flagged directly within Github.

<!-- Thing 3 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Indicator Labels" %}

{% capture text %}
Working with the Content Innovation team we added new indicator labels such as the "live" and "new" story labels to the
`o-labels` component. Previously the labels were implemented separately in multiple projects such as for teasers and the
live blogs page. Maintaining two implementations may cause future design inconsistency or require duplicate effort to
fix bugs. Now all projects can include `o-labels` instead of reinventing the indicator labels.

<!-- Special thanks -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Special Thanks" %}

{% capture text %}

This weeks special thanks goes to Chris Brown from the Data Strategy & Governance team. We have taken on stewardship and
maintenance of `o-tracking` this quarter and Chris has been very helpful, answering many of our Spoor and `o-tracking`
questions and pointing us to other useful contacts.

If you have `o-tracking` feedback or feature requests now would be a great time to [raise an o-tracking issue on
Github](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-tracking/issues).

Thanks again Chris!
