## Broader update

A digest of other things that have happened this month:

- o-tooltip: [Kirsten updated o-tooltip](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami/pull/419) to remove the close button for tooltips set to show on hover and those set to show on focus üéâ The close button didn't make sense in these scenarios: for example a user could never actually click on the close button when the tooltip was shown on hover; and there was a similar issue for keyboard users trying to navigate to the close button when the tooltip was shown on focus. Extra shout-out to Kirsten for improving our contribution documentation along the way, and for writing such a helpfully detailed <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr> description üëè
