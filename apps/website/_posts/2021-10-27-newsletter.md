A digest of other things that have happened this month:

- o-normalise: Mo [improved o-normalise](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami/pull/346) for users of voice control software like Dragon. Thanks, Mo!
- o-date: We [improved consistency and accessibility](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami/issues/203) by deprecating options for abbreviated date formats e.g. "1d ago" over "1 day ago". This format was [only used on myft topic cards](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami/issues/203), which we opened a PR to change.
