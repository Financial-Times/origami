## Use of Placeholder Text

**Donâ€™t use placeholder text to provide hints or instructions inside text input fields.**

Placeholders disappear as soon as the user starts typing, which means:

* The guidance is no longer visible when the user needs it most.
* It forces the user to rely on memory if they forget what was originally shown.
* It reduces accessibility, as some screen readers either ignore placeholder text or read it inconsistently.
* It can be mistaken for a filled-in value, especially for users scanning quickly.

Instead, use:

* Clear, persistent labels to describe the input
* Helper text below the field for optional instructions or format guidance
* Validation feedback for any errors or constraints after user interaction

Placeholder text should only be used when the purpose is purely decorative or supplementary, never as a replacement for a label or required instruction.

<Example do={false} title="Don't use the input box for hints">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="Password"
				attributes={{
					placeholder: 'Please use at least 8 characters',
				}}
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

<Example do title="Do use description fields for additional hints">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="Password"
				description="Please use at least 8 characters"
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>
