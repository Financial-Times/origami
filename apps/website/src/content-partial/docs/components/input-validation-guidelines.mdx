**Why we avoid real-time validation**

* Validating on every keystroke introduces error feedback noise that can feel overwhelming.
* Triggering errors too early is considered a hostile UX pattern. It punishes users while they’re still thinking.
* Changing a component’s visual state mid-interaction can feel unexpected or jarring, especially for keyboard and screen reader users.`;
