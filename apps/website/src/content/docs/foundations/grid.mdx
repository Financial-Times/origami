The standard FT grid system is designed to be flexible, responsive, and adaptable. It caters to a wide range of devices and screen sizes, ensuring consistency and harmony across all digital products.

This page covers the design and behaviour of grids. For technical details, please see the <a href={`https://o3.origami.ft.com/?path=/docs/${props.brand}-o3-foundation-o3-grid-readme--jsx-documentation`}>technical documentation in Storybook</a>. Note that the previous version of Origami (o2) uses a different grid system, for this [see o-grid](https://o2-core.origami.ft.com/index.html?path=/docs/maintained-o-grid-readme--docs&globals=backgrounds:!undefined). We recommend following the below design guidelines for any new projects.

## Grid Anatomy

![](/assets/images/components/grid/anatomy.svg)

1. **Columns:** The coloured blocks define the content area. Align field elements to a specific number of columns within this space.
2. **Gutters:** the space between the columns.
3. **Margins:** also known as outside gutters, the amount of white space outside of your content width.

## Grid Properties

### Dimensions

Our grid adapts to the following breakpoints to accommodate various screen sizes:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Breakpoint</th>
			<th>Range (px)</th>
			<th>Columns</th>
			<th>Gutter</th>
			<th>Margin</th>
			<th>Usage</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>XS</td>
			<td>320-489</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>16px</td>
			<td>16px</td>
			<td>Portrait - mobile</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>S</td>
			<td>490-739</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>16px</td>
			<td>16px</td>
			<td>
				Portrait - large mobile, small tablet <br />
				Landscape - mobile
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>M</td>
			<td>740-1023</td>
			<td>8</td>
			<td>16px</td>
			<td>24px</td>
			<td>
				Portrait - tablet <br />
				Landscape - large mobile, small tablet
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>L</td>
			<td>1024-1439</td>
			<td>12</td>
			<td>24px</td>
			<td>24px</td>
			<td>
				Landscape - large tablet, <br />
				desktop
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>XL</td>
			<td>1440+</td>
			<td>12</td>
			<td>24px</td>
			<td>24px – auto</td>
			<td>desktop</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

### Columns

Column widths are fluid and change with the size of the grid.

### Baseline

Following industry-standard, we use a 4px baseline which the grid, spacing and typography is based on.

## Grid Behaviour

### Contained Width

Our grid is fluid, it uses 100% of the screen’s width until the max width of 1312px (XL breakpoint) is reached. After this, the margins grow to fill the screen. This allows for maximum use of screen real estate in complex screens and readability of page content in large and high-definition screens.
Exceptions can be made for full-bleed banners, headers and graphics, to bleed out of the grid columns.

### Column Spanning

Layout regions can span any number of columns, separated by the grid gutter. You have the flexibility to set the number to reflect the responsive nature of your design.

### Layout Responsiveness

Responsive layout design adapts content layout to various screen types using a fluid layout. This ensures that features built once will display evenly across all screen sizes.

### Column Offset

Page content does not always need to span across 12 columns; it can occupy a smaller region within the page.

## Usage Guidelines

<Guideline summary="Do not use fractional column spans" do={true}>
	<div slot="description">
		<p>
			Use the gutter width to help determine the space between layout regions. At any breakpoint, only use a number of cards that are exact multiples of the grid column size.
		</p>
		<p>If layout doesn't divide evenly (e.g. 3 teasers in a 8-column grid), opt for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2 layout (2 columns each), or 4-layout (2 columns each).</li>
			<li>Apply horizontal scroll instead of breaking column alignment.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
    <Example slot="examples" do={true} centred={true}>
    	![Correct: Grid layout with even column spans showing 2- and 4-column layouts and horizontal scrolling to maintain alignment.](/assets/images/components/grid/usage-guidelines-fractional-column-spans-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false} centred={true}>
    	![Incorrect: Grid layout using fractional column spans (2.6), resulting in broken alignment and inconsistent spacing.](/assets/images/components/grid/usage-guidelines-fractional-column-spans-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Align Odd Content Blocks with Gutter Spacing" do={true}>
	<div slot="description">
		<p>In edge cases where odd number of content blocks cannot be aligned to the grid after applying the logic above, use the grid’s gutter size to space your content to maintain visual consistency.</p>
	</div>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true} centred={true}>
    	![Three content blocks spaced evenly on the grid, with 16px gutters between each block, showing how to align odd numbers of blocks consistently.](/assets/images/components/grid/usage-guidelines-align-content-blocks-with-gutter-spacing.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Align irregular or fixed sized content using invisible regions" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Sometimes content cannot align to the grid. For example, we do not always control the dimensions of an ad banner. In this scenario, imagine an invisible element around the content which does align to the grid. Ensure no other content overlaps this grid area.
	</p>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true} centred={true}>
    	![Correct: An example of fixed-size content (like an ad) aligned to the grid using an invisible container that preserves layout structure.](/assets/images/components/grid/usage-guidelines-align-irregular-fixed-size-content-invisible-regions.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Do not leave elements in the gutters" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Your elements should sit within the columns and not bleed into the gutters. You cannot leave elements in the gutters; that causes inconsistency and defeats the purpose of the grid.
	</p>
		
	<Example slot="examples" do={true} centred={true}>
    	![Correct: Grid layout with elements properly contained within columns, avoiding the gutters.](/assets/images/components/grid/usage-guidelines-do-not-leave-elements-in-gutter-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false} centred={true}>
    	![Incorrect: Grid layout with elements bleeding into gutters, disrupting column alignment.](/assets/images/components/grid/usage-guidelines-do-not-leave-elements-in-gutter-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

## Accessibility Considerations

<Guideline summary="Maintain readability range for article body" do={true}>
	<div slot="description">
		<p>Shorter lines are usually more comfortable to the reader. As the line length increases, the user’s eye has to travel further from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, making it harder to track their progress vertically. Aim for an average line length of 50–80 characters, including spaces.</p>
    </div>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true} centred={true}>
    	![Correct: Text block spans 6 columns, keeping line length within the recommended 50–80 characters for readability.](/assets/images/components/grid/accessibility-considerations-maintain-readability-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false} centred={true}>
    	![Text block spans 7 columns, exceeding the recommended 80-character line length and reducing reading comfort.](/assets/images/components/grid/accessibility-considerations-maintain-readability-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

## Chrome Extension for Grid Overlay

To aid in implementing and visualising the Origami grid system in your projects, we offer a Chrome extension that provides a customisable grid overlay for your web pages. This helps you understand how your website aligns to Origami's grid system.

Key features:

- Enable/disable grid overlay with a single click
- Customize column, gutter, and margin colors
- Adjust grid opacity
- Quick reset to default settings
