Buttons help people take action. In FT products, they support journeys, whether submitting a form, sharing content or progressing through a task. We aim for buttons to be clear, consistent and accessible across our products.

This guidance helps teams choose the correct button type, understand how buttons behave, and apply them consistently across layouts, devices and themes. If something here doesn’t fit your use case, let us know, we’ll help you find the right approach.

## Anatomy of a button

Each button includes:

<ButtonAnatomy />

1. <strong>Label:</strong> Clearly describe the action using a verb. Use specific,
   outcome-focused wording like "Subscribe" or "Continue".
2. <strong>Container:</strong> This wraps the label up and any optional icon. Standard.
   buttons should at least be 80px wide; small buttons should be no smaller than
   64px
3. <strong>Icon (optional):</strong> Include only when it helps clarify the action.
   Place it before the label, unless it visually suggests direction.

## Button Types

Choose a button type based on how much emphasis the action needs.

### Primary (High Emphasis)

Use for the most important action in a view. Stick to one per context to maintain a clear hierarchy.

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Primary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

### Secondary (Medium Emphasis)

This is used for actions that support or cancel the primary. It often appears alongside it.

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Secondary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'secondary'}}
/>

### Tertiary / Ghost (Low Emphasis)

This is used for optional or low-priority actions, such as ‘Skip’ or ‘Back.’ These are typically paired with a primary button and presented with lower visual emphasis.

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Ghost"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'ghost'}}
/>

### Icon-only (Low Emphasis)

Use to take supplementary actions with a single tap but only when the icon is universally recognised and adds clear meaning.

In areas like toolbars and menu bars, always pair icons with text labels for clarity.

<Preview
	previewFile="Icons-IconOnly"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{
		label: 'Hello',
		type: 'primary',
		icon: 'search',
		iconOnly: true,
	}}
/>

### Grouped Buttons (Low Emphasis)

Also known as Segmented buttons. Use them to toggle between closely related views, such as time periods (e.g. “Day”, “Week”, “Month”). Limit to six or fewer options. Limit to six or fewer options.

<GroupPreview brand={props.brand} />

### SSO Buttons

Single Sign On (<abbr title="Single Sign On">SSO</abbr>) buttons allows for use for third-party authentication, such as Google or Apple.

Always use consistent copy:

- “Sign in with [Provider]” for returning users
- “Sign up with [Provider]” for new users

<SocialPreview brand={props.brand} />

#### Branding Compliance Reference

Follow the platform visual and copy guidance closely.

## Ordering and Placement

Use the alignment pattern suited to the user flow and task context to help users complete tasks intuitively. Use one pattern per view or flow. Don't mix.

| Pattern   | Usage                                         | Reading behaviour                     | Placement                                     |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Z-Pattern | Focused flows, e.g modals or onboarding flows | Start-to-end scan <br/>(left → right) | Place primary right and secondary to the left |
| F-Pattern | Content-heavy layouts                         | Top-down, left-biased scan            | Align buttons left, primary action first      |

		},
	]}></Tip>

### Z-Pattern

Use for modals, onboarding flows, or focused tasks with a clear hierarchy. Right-aligned buttons ensure users naturally end their scan on the primary action, guiding them quickly and confidently through tasks.

![A Z-pattern layout guides the reader’s eye across a page in the shape of the letter Z. It starts at the top left, moves horizontally to the top right, then diagonally down to the bottom left, and ends at the bottom right. This flow is often used to lead users toward a call-to-action, such as a button placed at the end of the path.](/assets/images/components/buttons/ordering-placement-z-pattern.svg)

### F-Pattern

Left-align buttons only in content-heavy, full-page forms, or long-scrolling views where users primarily read top-down and scan horizontally. Left-aligned buttons reinforce task completion in contexts with substantial information.

![An F-pattern layout reflects how people typically scan blocks of text online. The eye moves across the top of the content, then down the left side, occasionally scanning shorter horizontal lines. This creates an F-shaped pattern. It’s commonly used for text-heavy pages, where key information is placed along the top and left edges to match this reading behaviour.](/assets/images/components/buttons/ordering-placement-f-pattern.svg)

Edge cases: If you've applied this and doesn't work for your use case. contact us, let’s discuss.

## Themes

Use themes to adjust tone and contrast based on context:

### Standard

Use as the default theme for most buttons.

<Preview
	previewFile="Themes-Standard"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

### Inverse

Use on dark backgrounds to maintain contrast.

<div data-o3-theme="inverse">
	<Preview
		previewFile="Themes-Inverse"
		brand={props.brand}
		componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'inverse'}}
	/>
</div>

<BrandedContent brands="core, sustainable-views">
### Mono

Use where minimal styling is needed, like beside charts or data visualisations.

<div data-o3-theme="mono">
	<Preview
		previewFile="Themes-Mono"
		brand={props.brand}
		componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'mono'}}
	/>
</div>
</BrandedContent>

<BrandedContent brands="core, professional">
### Neutral

Use for medium emphasis actions that have less priority then than the primary CTA but higher priority than an icon or ghost button. For example, the FT header.

<div data-o3-theme="neutral">
	<Preview
		previewFile="Themes-Neutral"
		brand={props.brand}
		componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'neutral'}}
	/>
</div>

<strong>Note:</strong> Not all themes are supported across all button types. If something doesn’t fit your use case, contact the Design Systems team for guidance.
</BrandedContent>

## Sizes

### Standard (Default)

Use for most cases.

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Primary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

### Small

Use in compact layouts like toolbars. Avoid small buttons on mobile unless absolutely required. When used, allow a touch area of at least 44px.

<Preview
	previewFile="Sizes-Small"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', size: 'small'}}
/>

## Responsive Behaviour

Buttons are fluid up to ~400px, then adapt to their content.<br /><em>(Resize your browser to preview the fluid button’s responsive width)</em>

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Primary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Example', type: 'primary'}}
/>

## Usage Guidelines

<Guideline summary="Full-width usage" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Use full-width buttons only in narrow containers such as mobile layouts.
	</p>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct layout: Two boxes side by side, each with a button at the bottom. On mobile, buttons are full-width; on desktop, buttons are bottom-left aligned.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-full-width-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect layout: a single box with a full-width button at the bottom on desktop. This style is intended for mobile viewports only.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-full-width-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Only one primary button per product area" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		To maintain clarity, use only one primary button per product area (a form, modal, within an article). For all other CTAs, use secondary or ghost buttons.
	</p>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct layout: two buttons side by side. The first is a primary button—used only once per product area. The second is a secondary or ghost button.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-only-one-primary-button-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect layout: two primary buttons side by side in the same product area. Only one primary button should be used per area.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-only-one-primary-button-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Icons in button should be on the left" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Place icons on the left side of the button label, unless direction is being conveyed.
	</p>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct layout: two buttons. The first has a pencil icon on the left and says ‘Edit’. The second says ‘What’s included’ with a down chevron on the right, indicating direction. Icons appear on the left unless used to convey direction.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-icons-placement-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect layout: a button with a pencil icon on the left, a plus icon on the right, and the text ‘Edit’. Icons should not appear on both sides unless the right icon conveys direction.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-icons-placement-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Group related buttons where it helps the user." do={true}>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
		![Correct layout: one standalone ‘View’ button, which represents an action.
		Beside it, ‘Topic’ and ‘Timeline’ buttons are grouped together to indicate
		modes. Clear distinction is made between action (View) and modes (Topic,
		Timeline).](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-group-releated-buttons-do.svg)
	</Example>
</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Limit to 6 buttons per group" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Only group related actions when it helps the user. Keep to a maximum of 6 buttons per group. When the action switches content, use tabs instead of button groups.
	</p>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct layout: a group of three buttons labeled Seconds, Minutes, and Hours. The group stays within the recommended limit of six buttons.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-limit-6-buttons-group-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect layout: a group of seven buttons labeled Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, and Year. This exceeds the recommended limit of six buttons per group.](/assets/images/components/buttons/usage-limit-6-buttons-group-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

## Button Label Guidance

Button labels should be outcome-focused, short and easy to scan.

<Guideline summary="Use clear, action-driven language (e.g. 'Share', 'Download')" do={true}>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct implementation: a button labeled ‘Share’. The label uses clear, action-driven language.](/assets/images/components/buttons/label-guidance-action-driven-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect implementation: a button labeled ‘Share on your social media of choice’. This label is overly wordy and lacks clear, action-driven language.](/assets/images/components/buttons/label-guidance-action-driven-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Do not use filler words, punctuation or unnecessary articles ('the', 'a')" do={true}>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct implementation: a button labeled ‘Continue’. The label is concise, direct, and free of filler words, punctuation, or unnecessary articles.](/assets/images/components/buttons/label-guidance-filler-words-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect implementation: a button labeled ‘Continue to the next section’. The label is too long and includes unnecessary words and articles, reducing clarity.](/assets/images/components/buttons/label-guidance-filler-words-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Write labels in sentence case" do={true}>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct implementation: a button labeled ‘Share now’. The label uses sentence case, which improves readability and aligns with design guidelines.](/assets/images/components/buttons/label-guidance-sentence-case-do.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect implementation: a button labeled ‘Share Now’. The use of title case reduces readability and doesn’t follow sentence case guidelines.](/assets/images/components/buttons/label-guidance-sentence-case-dont.svg)
    </Example>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Incorrect implementation: a button labeled ‘SHARE NOW’. Using all caps reduces readability and may be perceived as shouting. Sentence case is preferred.](/assets/images/components/buttons/label-guidance-sentence-case-dont-too.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

## Accessibility Considerations

<Guideline summary="Ensure contrast meets WCAG standards" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Only use if backed by user research. They often have poor contrast, don’t explain why they’re inactive, and can cause confusion, especially for screen reader users or in accessibility audits.
	</p>

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    	![Poor implementation of a button with low contrast and no clear reason for being inactive. This can confuse users, especially those with visual impairments, and fails to communicate why the button can’t be used.](/assets/images/components/buttons/accessibility-considerations-contrast-dont.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="All buttons must have at least a 44px target size" do={true}>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![Correct implementation: The button must have a minimum target size of 44px to meet accessibility standards and ensure it’s easy to tap on touch devices.](/assets/images/components/buttons/accessibility-considerations-44pixels-target-size-do.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>
