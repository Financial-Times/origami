Buttons are triggers that provide users with a call to action. Typically allowing users to execute, choose, submit and confirm actions.

## FT Buttons

FT buttons are those that are designed for FT's digital products, with FT branding.

<ButtonAnatomy />

1. <strong>Icon (optional)</strong>: Most buttons don't need an icon. Use an
   icon to add additional affordance where the icon has a clear and
   well-established meaning.
1. <strong>Label</strong>: Text that explains the result of selecting the
   button. Use action verbs or phrases to tell the user what will happen next.
1. <strong>Container</strong>: has minimum width of 80px for standard buttons
   and 64px for small buttons.

### Usage Guidelines

<Guideline summary="Keep button labels short" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Keep labels short and free of punctuation. They should confirm the action a
		user is taking. Drop unnecessary articles, such as ‘a’ or ‘the’, for a more
		concise label.
	</p>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
		<Button label="Share" type="primary" />
	</Example>
	<Example slot="examples" do={false}>
		<Button label="Share on your social media of choice" type="primary" />
	</Example>
</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Use sentence case for button labels" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Only capitalize the first letter of the button and any proper nouns. Not
		title case or Upper case.
	</p>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
		<Button label="Share now" type="primary" />
	</Example>
	<Example slot="examples" do={false}>
		<Button label="Share Now" type="primary" />
	</Example>
	<Example slot="examples" do={false}>
		<Button label="SHARE NOW" type="primary" />
	</Example>
</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Don’t use more than one primary button" do={false}>
	<p slot="description">
		Each page or product area (a form, modal, within an article) should not have
		more than 1 primary button to help guide the user to the primary action. Any
		remaining CTA's should be displayed as secondary or ghost buttons.
	</p>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
		<Button label="Share" type="primary" />
		<Button label="Cancel" type="secondary" />
	</Example>
	<Example slot="examples" do={false}>
		<Button label="Share" type="primary" />
		<Button label="Cancel" type="primary" />
	</Example>
</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Avoid disabled buttons without user research" do={false}>
    <div slot="description">
        Avoid disabled buttons unless user research shows they improve your interface. Disabled buttons have poor contrast which makes them difficult to read. They also do not give feedback to a user why they are disabled. This has caused issues for FT readers in the past, and has been flagged in previous accessibility audits.

        Hampus Sethfors explains the issues with disabled buttons in more detail in an [axesslab.com article](https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/). In the article Hampus suggests alternative design approaches for common uses of disabled buttons.

    <Example slot="examples" do={false}>
        <Button label="Submit" type="primary" attributes={{disabled: true}} />
    </Example>

<Guideline summary="Don’t use full width buttons in wide containers" do={false}>
    <div slot="description">
		Instead use <a href="#width">fluid buttons</a>, which are full-width for small devices or containers up to around 400px width. Otherwise, button width should default to its content length.
    </div>

    <Example slot="examples" do={true}>

</Guideline>

#### Width

A button's width is dependant on the length of its content by default. Alternatively buttons may be "fluid", and stretch to fill the full width of their container.

We recommend buttons are fluid until around 400px, after which the button should be determined by the length of its content.

_(Resize your browser to preview the fluid button's responsive width)_

<Preview
	brand={props.brand}
	previewFile="Fluid"
	component={Button}
	componentProps={{label: 'Fluid button', type: 'primary', fluid: true}}
/>

### Icons

Buttons may be used with icons, without icons, or only icons.

#### Without icon

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Primary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

#### With icon

When icons are used, these are always left aligned.

<Preview
	previewFile="Icons-WithIcon"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', icon: 'search'}}
/>

#### Only icon

<Preview
	previewFile="Icons-IconOnly"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{
		label: 'Hello',
		type: 'primary',
		icon: 'search',
		iconOnly: true,
	}}
/>

### Sizes

The button comes in two sizes: standard and small.

#### Standard

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Primary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

#### Small

<Preview
	previewFile="Sizes-Small"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', size: 'small'}}
/>

### Types

There are three types of buttons to support different contexts.

#### Primary

The primary button is used for the most important calls to action on a page. Primary buttons should only appear once per product area (not including the application header, modal dialogue, on-site messaging, or side panel).

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Primary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

#### Secondary

For secondary actions on each page or used in conjunction with a primary button. As part of a pair, the secondary button’s function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel” or “Back”.

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Secondary"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'secondary'}}
/>

#### Ghost

For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button. In a situation such as a progress flow, a ghost button may be paired with a primary and secondary button set, where the primary button is for ‘Save and continue’ the ghost button would be ‘Skip’.

<Preview
	previewFile="Types-Ghost"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'ghost'}}
/>

### Themes

Each button type supports the following themes.

#### Standard

<Preview
	previewFile="Themes-Standard"
	brand={props.brand}
	componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary'}}
/>

#### Inverse

An alternative theme for use on dark backgrounds.

<div data-o3-theme="inverse">
	<Preview
		previewFile="Themes-Inverse"
		brand={props.brand}
		componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'inverse'}}
	/>
</div>

<BrandedContent brands="core, sustainable-views">
#### Mono

Mono can be helpful where the standard theme distracts from other colour used, for example when placed near data visualisations.

<div data-o3-theme="mono">
	<Preview
		previewFile="Themes-Mono"
		brand={props.brand}
		componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'mono'}}
	/>
</div>
</BrandedContent>

<BrandedContent brands="core, professional">
#### Neutral

The neutral theme allows for reduced emphasis, to support the hierarchy of the page. It is used for Ask FT in the header, and sharable anchor links within live blogs. It is available in either primary or ghost button types. It is not supported with the secondary button type.

<div data-o3-theme="neutral">
	<Preview
		previewFile="Themes-Neutral"
		brand={props.brand}
		componentProps={{label: 'Hello', type: 'primary', theme: 'neutral'}}
	/>
</div>
</BrandedContent>

## FT Button Groups

Buttons may be grouped to combine related buttons together which present users with a set of related, frequently used actions or options in a compact and organized manner.

In terms of user experience, button groups provide a straightforward way for users to perform actions within a single context, emphasizing action over navigation.

<GroupPreview brand={props.brand} />

### Usage Guidelines

<Guideline summary="Use grouped buttons for related actions" do={true}>
	<p slot="description">
		Group related actions or options closely together to improve usability and
		decision-making efficiency. For example, use for switching views or modes
		within the same context, such as changing calendar views from day, week, to
		month
	</p>
	<Example slot="examples" do={true}>
		![A labelled group of buttons. The label reads "view", it is annotated for
		demonstration purposes as the "action". The two buttons read "topic" and
		"timeline". The "topic" button is
		pressed.](/assets/images/components/buttons/group-guideline-1.svg)

    	![A labelled group of buttons. The label reads "view". The two buttons read
    	"topic" and "timeline". The buttons are annotated as "mode" for
    	demonstration purposes. The "topic" button is
    	pressed.](/assets/images/components/buttons/group-guideline-2.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Don't use grouped buttons for navigation" do={false}>
	<p slot="description">
		Use tabs instead to imply navigation between different content areas or
		contexts within the same workspace.
	</p>
	<Example slot="examples" do={false}>
    		![](/assets/images/components/buttons/group-guideline-3.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

<Guideline summary="Limit the number of buttons in a group" do={false}>
	<p slot="description">
		Never use groups of more than six buttons, as too many calls to action can
		cause users to be unsure of what to do next. Also be thoughtful about how
		multiple buttons will look and work on small screens, this may vary
		according the the length of the button's label.
	</p>
    <Example slot="examples" do={true}>
    	![](/assets/images/components/buttons/group-guideline-5.svg)

    	![](/assets/images/components/buttons/group-guideline-4.svg)
    </Example>

</Guideline>

## Single Sign On

Single Sign On (<abbr title="Single Sign On">SSO</abbr>) buttons allow users to sign in or sign up using 3rd party platforms. We provide the visual style of these and leave platform integration to the developer.

<SocialPreview brand={props.brand} />

### Usage Guidelines

#### Sign up vs Sign in

Ensure consistent wording for different user flows. This may be changed if needed, but refer to [Apple and Google guidelines below](#branding-compliance-reference) on appropriate wording. We recommend:

- "Sign in with [Provider]" for login
- "Sign up with [Provider]" for registration

#### Responsiveness

The <abbr title="Single Sign On">SSO</abbr> button spans the full-width of its container to increase tap area on mobile, up to a maximum width of [4 grid columns](/foundations/grid/) on tablet and desktop. When used with form fields, always align SSO button width to ensure consistency.

#### Branding Compliance Reference

- [Google's guidelines](https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines)
