## Anatomy

<TextInputAnatomy />

1. Label: Indicates the purpose of the text input field. It should clearly communicate what kind of information is expected.
2. Description: Provides additional context/instructions about the text input field. It helps users understand what is required or gives examples of the kind of information they should enter.
3. Optional indicator: Indicates fields that are not mandatory.
4. Input box: the interactive area where users can type their input
5. Input text: The text string entered by the user. This is not placeholder text and only applies when the user has typed.
6. Feedback message: provides users with response regarding their input. For now it’s only errors. The feedback message should be clear and specific, guiding the user on any necessary actions

## Usage Guidelines

### Width

As layouts adapt to larger screens, flexible container dimensions are applied to form components for better readability. The default width is 4 grid columns—343px on mobile, expanding to 422px on desktop for an optimized experience.

<InputWidthExample brand={props.brand} />

In most cases, the input field follows the standard forms width, which adapts to the layout. However, when the expected user input is a short string of characters, it’s better to use a properly-sized input field:

<ShortTextEample brand={props.brand} />

## Placeholder Text

The input box should never be used to display a text hint for the user.

<Example do title="Use description fields for additional hints">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="Password"
				description="Please use at least 8 characters"
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

<Example do={false} title="Never use the input box for hints">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="Password"
				attributes={{
					placeholder: 'Please use at least 8 characters',
				}}
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

<Tip>
	<p>
		Using placeholder text is considered a bad practice because the hint
		disappears once the user starts typing, with no obvious way to retrieve it
		and forces the user to have to rely on memory.
	</p>
