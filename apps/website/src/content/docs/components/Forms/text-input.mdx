## Anatomy of a Text Input

<TextInputAnatomy style={{textAlign: 'center'}} />

1. **Label:** Indicates the purpose of the text input field. It should clearly communicate what kind of information is expected.
2. **Description:** Provides additional instructions about the text input field. It helps users understand what is required or gives examples of the kind of information they should enter.
3. **Optional indicator:** Indicates fields that are not mandatory.
4. **Input box:** the interactive area where users can type their input.
5. **Input text:** The input entered by the user. This is not placeholder text and only applies when the user has typed.
6. **Feedback message:** provides users with response regarding their input. For now, it is only errors. The feedback message should be clear and specific, guiding the user on any necessary actions.

## Usage Guidelines

### Field Sizes

As layouts adapt to larger screens, flexible container dimensions are applied to form components for better readability. The default width is 4 grid columns (343px on mobile, expanding to 422px on desktop) for an optimized experience.

<InputWidthExample brand={props.brand} />

In most cases, the input field follows the standard form width, which adapts to the layout. However, when the expected user input short, itâ€™s better to use an appropriately sized input field:

#### Four Characters

<ShortTextFourEample brand={props.brand} />

#### Three Characters

<ShortTextThreeEample brand={props.brand} />

#### Two Characters

<ShortTextTwoEample brand={props.brand} />

## Label Content and Tone

Form field labels should be clear, concise, and easy to scan. We use sentence case for all labels and adopt a neutral, human tone to make forms more approachable and accessible.

Write labels with only the first word capitalized, unless the label includes a proper noun (like "UK" or "Google").

This makes labels easier to read at a glance and better aligns with how people naturally process language in user interfaces.

<Example do={false} title="Avoid title case">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="First Name"
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

<Example do title="Use sentence case">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="First name"
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

**Use a neutral and helpful tone**

* Avoid overly technical or legal language.
* Speak as the product would speak: polite, direct, and helpful, not robotic.
* Labels should describe the information being requested, not the UI element. For example, use Phone number not Enter your phone number here.
* Never use punctuation (no colons, no full stops)
* Avoid vague or clever language; clarity always comes first.

âœ… Good label tone:

* Company website
* Delivery address
* Password

ðŸš« Avoid:
* Please enter your delivery address
* What's your password?
* Website for your company:
* By writing with sentence case and a neutral tone, we help users move through forms more efficiently and with less friction, especially in long or complex interactions.

## Input Validation & Feedback

<InputValidationGuidelines />

## Submit Button Requirements

All data entered through input components must be submitted using a dedicated button, typically labeled Submit, Save, or something contextually relevant.

<Example do title="Include a button with a clear call to action to submit data">
<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
	<Form>
		<TextInput
			label="Email"
		/>
		<PasswordInput
			label="Password"
			/>
		<button type="submit" className="o3-button o3-button--primary">Log in</button>
	</Form>
</div>
</Example>

Why a submit button is required:

* It clearly signals to the user that their input needs confirmation.
* It provides an explicit action to complete the task and save the information.
* Without submission, info is lost if the user navigates away, closes the page, or reloads.


**Exception:** Immediate Components

The only exception to this rule is components that take effect immediately, such as toggle switches.
