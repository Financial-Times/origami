Text inputs allow users to enter free-form text data such as filling in contact or payment information.

## Anatomy of a Text Input

<TextInputAnatomy centred={true} />

1. **Label:** Indicates the purpose of the text input field. It should clearly communicate what kind of information is expected.
2. **Description:** Provides additional instructions about the text input field. It helps users understand what is required or gives examples of the kind of information they should enter.
3. **Optional indicator:** Indicates fields that are not mandatory.
4. **Input box:** the interactive area where users can type their input.
5. **Input text:** The input entered by the user. This is not placeholder text and only applies when the user has typed.
6. **Feedback message:** provides users with response regarding their input. For now, it is only errors. The feedback message should be clear and specific, guiding the user on any necessary actions.

## Usage Guidelines

### Field Sizes

As layouts adapt to larger screens, flexible container dimensions are applied to form components for better readability. The default width is 4 grid columns (343px on mobile, expanding to 422px on desktop) for an optimized experience.

<InputWidthExample brand={props.brand} />

In most cases, the input field follows the standard form width, which adapts to the layout. However, when the expected user input short, it’s better to use an appropriately sized input field:

#### Four Characters

<ShortTextFourEample brand={props.brand} />

#### Three Characters

<ShortTextThreeEample brand={props.brand} />

#### Two Characters

<ShortTextTwoEample brand={props.brand} />

## Placement in Layouts

Whether you're designing a Z-pattern or an F-pattern layout, placing input components consistently improves readability and user flow.
Follow these two foundational rules:

**1. Always left-align components.**

Align inputs and labels to the left to support natural reading flow and reduce cognitive load, especially in forms with multiple fields.

**2. Stack components vertically rather than placing them side by side.**

Vertical stacking is easier to scan, reduces ambiguity about which label belongs to which input, and works better across screen sizes and accessibility contexts.

<Example do={false} title="Don't Center components or place them side by side">
	<PlaceholderDont />
</Example>

<Example do title="Do Left-align components and stack them vertically">
	<PlaceholderDo />
</Example>

<Tip icon={true}>The vertical order of input components is crucial for helping users navigate efficiently. A clear
	top-to-bottom layout aligns with natural reading patterns, ensuring a smoother experience. Avoid placing components
	horizontally, as it can disrupt the flow and lead to confusion.</Tip>

## Interactive States

### Default

<InputStateDefault brand={props.brand} />

### Focus

<InputStateFocus brand={props.brand} />

### Error

<InputStateError brand={props.brand} />

### Disabled

<InputStateDisabled brand={props.brand} />

## Guidance on Disabled States

* Only use disabled inputs when absolutely necessary, and always provide a **clear explanation** of why the field is disabled and how it can be enabled.
* A common acceptable use case is for displaying read-only information that the user should see but not edit.

<InputStateDisabledGuidance brand={props.brand} />

When used without sufficient context, disabled inputs can:

* Confuse users or make them feel stuck
* Hide important information or functionality
* Prevent error recovery or correction
* Introduce accessibility issues, as screen readers may skip over disabled elements or fail to communicate their purpose

If a field must be temporarily unavailable, consider alternatives like making it read-only, providing inline messaging, or restructuring the flow to avoid exposing it unnecessarily.

## Required & Optional Inputs

By default, all input fields are considered required, unless explicitly marked as optional.

We intentionally do not display a “required” label or symbol. Instead, only optional fields are labeled, which simplifies the interface and reduces visual noise.

Why we don’t label required fields:

* Reduces cognitive load by eliminating redundant information
* Improves scannability in forms with multiple inputs
* Avoids visual clutter, especially when form labels are stacked vertically

This approach helps identify what they can skip, without having to mentally process which fields they must complete.

<Example do title="Do: mark all optional input fields">
	<Form>
		<TextInput label="Street Address" />
		<TextInput label="Apartment number" optional />
	</Form>
</Example>

## Label Content and Tone

Form field labels should be clear, concise, and easy to scan. We use sentence case for all labels and adopt a neutral, human tone to make forms more approachable and accessible.

Write labels with only the first word capitalized, unless the label includes a proper noun (like "UK" or "Google").

This makes labels easier to read at a glance and better aligns with how people naturally process language in user interfaces.

<Example do={false} title="Avoid title case">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="First Name"
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

<Example do title="Use sentence case">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="First name"
			/>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

**Use a neutral and helpful tone**

* Avoid overly technical or legal language.
* Speak as the product would speak: polite, direct, and helpful, not robotic.
* Labels should describe the information being requested, not the UI element. For example, use Phone number not Enter your phone number here.
* Never use punctuation (no colons, no full stops)
* Avoid vague or clever language; clarity always comes first.

<Example do={false} title="Don't use conversational or instructional phrasing">
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="Please enter your delivery address"
			/>
			<TextInput
				label="Website for your company"
			/>
		</Form>
</Example>

<Example dotitle="Do use clear, concise labels">
	<Form>
		<TextInput
			label="Delivery address"
		/>
		<TextInput
			label="Company website"
		/>
	</Form>
</Example>

<PlaceholderText />

## Input Validation & Feedback

<InputValidationGuidelines />

## Submit Button Requirements

All data entered through input components must be submitted using a dedicated button, typically labeled Submit, Save, or something contextually relevant.

<Example do title="Do include a button with a clear call to action">
	<div data-o3-brand={props.brand}>
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				label="Email"
			/>
			<PasswordInput
				label="Password"
			/>
			<button type="submit" className="o3-button o3-button--primary">Log in</button>
		</Form>
	</div>
</Example>

Why a submit button is required:

* It clearly signals to the user that their input needs confirmation.
* It provides an explicit action to complete the task and save the information.
* Without submission, info is lost if the user navigates away, closes the page, or reloads.


**Exception:** Immediate Components

The only exception to this rule is components that take effect immediately, such as toggle switches.
