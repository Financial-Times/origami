The password input component is used for entering sensitive information, such as passwords or passphrases. It masks the user's input to maintain privacy and security by replacing typed characters with symbols like dots or asterisks.

## Anatomy of a Password Input

<TextInputAnatomy />

1. **Title:** Clearly indicates that this is a password input field.
1. **Text hint:** Provides instructions about the password requirements.
1. **Show password toggle:** An option that users can activate to unmask their input.
1. **Forgot password:** Provides access to the functionality to reset a password.
1. **Input box:** The interactive area where users can type their passwords. Characters are masked to ensure privacy.

## Placement in Layouts

Whether you're designing a Z-pattern or an F-pattern layout, placing input components consistently improves readability and user flow.

Follow these two foundational rules:

**1. Always left-align components.**

Align inputs and labels to the left to support natural reading flow and reduce cognitive load, especially in forms with multiple fields.

**2. Stack components vertically rather than placing them side by side.**
Vertical stacking is easier to scan, reduces ambiguity about which label belongs to which input, and works better across screen sizes and accessibility contexts.

<Tip icon={true} sources={[{title: "", url: ""}]}>
	The vertical order of input components is crucial for helping users navigate efficiently. A clear top-to-bottom layout
	aligns with natural reading patterns, ensuring a smoother experience. Avoid placing components horizontally, as it can
	disrupt the flow and lead to confusion.

### Disabled

## Guidance on Disabled States

Password inputs support a disabled state, but it should be used **sparingly and with care**.

* Only use disabled inputs when absolutely necessary, and always provide a clear explanation of why the field is disabled and how it can be enabled.
* A common acceptable use case is for displaying read-only information that the user should see but not edit.


<PasswordDisabled brand={props.brand} />

When used without sufficient context, disabled inputs can:

* Confuse users or make them feel stuck
* Hide important information or functionality
* Prevent error recovery or correction
* Introduce accessibility issues, as screen readers may skip over disabled elements or fail to communicate their purpose


If a field must be temporarily unavailable, consider alternatives like making it read-only, providing inline messaging, or restructuring the flow to avoid exposing it unnecessarily.

## Label Content and Tone

Form field labels should be clear, concise, and easy to scan. We use sentence case for all labels and adopt a neutral, human tone to make forms more approachable and accessible.

Write labels with only the first word capitalized, unless the label includes a proper noun (like "UK" or "Google").

This makes labels easier to read at a glance and better aligns with how people naturally process language in user interfaces.

<Example do={false} title="Avoid title case">
	<Form>
		<PasswordInput
			id="password-input-title-case"
			label="Password"
			placeholder="Text hint" />
	</Form>
</Example>

<Example do title="Use sentence case">
	<Form>
		<PasswordInput
			id="password-input-title-case"
			label="Password"
			placeholder="Text hint" />
	</Form>
</Example>

Use a Neutral and Helpful Tone

* Avoid overly technical or legal language.
* Speak as the product would speak: polite, direct, and helpful, not robotic.
* Labels should describe the information being requested, not the UI element. For example, use Phone number, not Enter your phone number here.
* Never use punctuation (no colons, no full stops).
* Avoid vague or clever language; clarity always comes first.


‚úÖ Good label tone:

* Company website
* Delivery address
* Password


üö´ Avoid:
* Please enter your delivery address
* What's your password?
* Website for your company:
* By writing with sentence case and a neutral tone, we help users move through forms more efficiently and with less friction, especially in long or complex interactions.

## Input Validation & Feedback

## Password Confirmation

When creating a new account, users should only be asked to enter their password once.

Eliminating the ‚ÄúConfirm password‚Äù field streamlines the registration process by reducing friction, lowering drop-off rates, and speeding up completion.

<Example do={false} title="Never ask the user to re-type their password">
		<Form>
			<TextInput
				id="password-input-confirmation"
				label="Create a password"
				type="password"
			/>
			<TextInput
				id="password-input-confirmation"
				label="Repeat password"
				type='password'
			/>
		</Form>
</Example>

<Example do title="Ask for password only once">
	<Form>
		<TextInput
			id="password-input-confirmation"
			label="Create a password"
			type='password'
		/>
	</Form>
</Example>

Instead, improve accuracy and confidence by providing a:

* "Show password" toggle, allowing users to verify their input visually.
* Clear password requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters) before or during input.
* Real-time feedback on strength or validity if needed, but only after the user stops typing or on blur.


Benefits of Removing the Confirmation Field:

* Fewer form fields means a faster, more user-friendly experience.
* Prevents user frustration caused by mismatched fields.
* Encourages users to visually verify their password instead of retyping.


## Submit Button Requirements

All data entered through input components must be submitted using a dedicated button, typically labeled Submit, Save, or something contextually relevant.

<Example do title="Include a button with a clear call to action to submit data">
	<Form>
		<TextInput
			id="email-input"
			label="Email"
			type='email'
			/>
		<TextInput
			id="password-input]"
			label="Password"
			type='password'
		/>
		<Button type="primary" label='Login' />
	</Form>
</Example>


Why a Submit Button is Required:

* It clearly signals to the user that their input needs confirmation.
* It provides an explicit action to complete the task and persist the data.
* Without submission, data is lost if the user navigates away, closes the page, or reloads.


**Exception:** Immediate Components

The only exception to this rule is components that take effect immediately, such as toggle switches.
