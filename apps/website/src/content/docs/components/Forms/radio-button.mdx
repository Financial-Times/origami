## Anatomy

<RadioButtonAnatomy />

1. **Label:** Indicates the purpose of the radio buttons. It should clearly communicate what kind of decision has to be made
1. **Description:** Provides additional context/instructions
1. **Optional indicator:** indicated that the choice is not mandatory
1. **Radio button:** The radio button selection control.
1. **Radio button label:** Describes the purpose of the radio buttons. It should clearly communicate what kind of choice is expected.

## Placement in Layouts

Whether you're designing a Z-pattern or an F-pattern layout, placing input components consistently improves readability and user flow.

Follow these two foundational rules:\

**1. Always left-align components.**

Align inputs and labels to the left to support natural reading flow and reduce cognitive load, especially in forms with multiple fields.

**2. Stack components vertically rather than placing them side by side.**

Vertical stacking is easier to scan, reduces ambiguity about which label belongs to which input, and works better across screen sizes and accessibility contexts.

<Tip icon>
	The vertical order of input components is crucial for helping users navigate efficiently. A clear top-to-bottom layout
	aligns with natural reading patterns, ensuring a smoother experience. Avoid placing components horizontally, as it can
	disrupt the flow and lead to confusion.

## Interactive States

### Default

<RadioButtonSelectionDefault brand={props.brand} />

### Hover

### Focus

### Pressed

### Disabled

<RadioButtonSelectionDisabled brand={props.brand} />

### Error

## Guidance on Disabled States

Radio buttons support a disabled state, but it should be used **sparingly and with care.**


* Only use disabled radio buttons when absolutely necessary, and always provide a clear explanation of why the field is disabled and how it can be enabled.
* A common acceptable use case is for displaying read-only information that the user should see but not edit.

<RadioButtonDisabled brand={props.brand} />

When used without sufficient context, disabled inputs can:
* Confuse users or make them feel stuck
* Hide important information or functionality
* Prevent error recovery or correction
* Introduce accessibility issues, as screen readers may skip over disabled elements or fail to communicate their purpose


If a field must be temporarily unavailable, consider alternatives like making it read-only, providing inline messaging, or restructuring the flow to avoid exposing it unnecessarily.

## Required and Optional Inputs

By default, all radio button components are considered required, unless explicitly marked as optional.

We intentionally do not display a ‚Äúrequired‚Äù label or symbol. Instead, only optional fields are labeled, which simplifies the interface and reduces visual noise.

Why we don‚Äôt label required fields:

* Reduces cognitive load by eliminating redundant information.
* Improves scannability in forms with multiple inputs.
* Avoids visual clutter, especially when form labels are stacked vertically.

This approach helps users focus only on what they can skip, without having to mentally process which fields they must complete.

<Example do title="Do mark optional input fields">
	<Form>
		<RadioButtonGroupComponent label="How did you hear about us?" optional>
			<RadioButtonItem radioButtonLabel="Social media" />
			<RadioButtonItem radioButtonLabel="Friend" />
			<RadioButtonItem radioButtonLabel="Other" />
		</RadioButtonGroupComponent>
	</Form>
</Example>

## Label Content and Tone

Form field labels should be clear, concise, and easy to scan. We use sentence case for all labels and adopt a neutral, human tone to make forms more approachable and accessible.

Write labels with only the first word capitalized, unless the label includes a proper noun (like "UK" or "Google").

This makes labels easier to read at a glance and better aligns with how people naturally process language in user interfaces.

<Example do={false} title="Don't use title case">
	<Form>
		<RadioButtonGroupComponent label="How did you hear about us?">
			<RadioButtonItem key="1" radioButtonLabel="Social Media" />
			<RadioButtonItem key="2" radioButtonLabel="Friend" />
			<RadioButtonItem key="3" radioButtonLabel="Other" />
		</RadioButtonGroupComponent>
	</Form>
</Example>

<Example do title="Use sentence case">
	<Form>
		<RadioButtonGroupComponent label="How did you hear about us?">
			<RadioButtonItem key="1" radioButtonLabel="Social media" />
			<RadioButtonItem key="2" radioButtonLabel="Friend" />
			<RadioButtonItem key="3" radioButtonLabel="Other" />
		</RadioButtonGroupComponent>
	</Form>
</Example>

Use a Neutral and Helpful Tone

* Avoid overly technical or legal language.
* Speak as the product would speak: polite, direct, and helpful, not robotic.
* Labels should describe the information being requested, not the UI element. For example, use Phone number, not Enter your phone number here.
* Never use punctuation (no colons, no full stops).
* Avoid vague or clever language; clarity always comes first.


‚úÖ Good label tone:

* Company website
* Delivery address
* Password

üö´ Avoid:

* Please enter your delivery address
* What's your password?
* Website for your company:

By writing with sentence case and a neutral tone, we help users move through forms more efficiently and with less friction, especially in long or complex interactions.

## Use for Small Sets

Radio buttons are best suited for small sets of options (typically 2 to 5). For larger sets of options, consider using a dropdown menu instead to reduce visual clutter.

## Mutually Exclusive Choices

Only use radio buttons when the options are mutually exclusive. If multiple selections are possible, consider using <a href={`/${props.brand}/components/forms/checkbox/`}>checkboxes</a> instead.

<RadioButtonExclusiveChoicesGuideline brand={props.brand} />

## Preselected Option

If one of the options is the most common or recommended, pre-select it as the default option. However, ensure it‚Äôs easy for the user to change their selection.

<RadioButtonGroup brand={props.brand} />

## Submit Button Requirements

All data entered through input components must be submitted using a dedicated button, typically labeled Submit, Save, or something contextually relevant.

<Example do title="Include a button with a clear call to action">
	<Form>
		<RadioButtonGroupComponent label="How did you hear about us?">
			<RadioButtonItem key="1" radioButtonLabel="Social media" inputId="1" />
			<RadioButtonItem key="2" radioButtonLabel="Friend" inputId="2" />
			<RadioButtonItem key="3" radioButtonLabel="Other" inputId="3" />
		</RadioButtonGroupComponent>
		<Button type="primary" label="Submit" />
	</Form>
</Example>

Why a Submit Button is Required:

* It clearly signals to the user that their input needs confirmation.
* It provides an explicit action to complete the task and persist the data.
* Without submission, data is lost if the user navigates away, closes the page, or reloads.

**Exception:** Immediate Components

The only exception to this rule is components that take effect immediately, such as toggle switches.
