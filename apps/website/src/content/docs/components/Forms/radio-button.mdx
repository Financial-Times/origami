## Anatomy

<RadioButtonAnatomy />

1. Label: Indicates the purpose of the radio buttons. It should clearly communicate what kind of decision has to be made
2. Description: Provides additional context/instructions
3. Radio button: The radio button selection control.
4. Radio button label: Describes the purpose of the radio buttons. It should clearly communicate what kind of choice is expected.

## Usage Guidelines

### Use for Small Sets

Radio buttons are best suited for small sets of options (typically 2 to 5). For larger sets of options, consider using a dropdown menu instead to reduce visual clutter.

### Use for Mutually Exclusive Choices

Only use radio buttons when the options are mutually exclusive. If multiple selections are possible, consider using <a href={`/${props.brand}/components/forms/checkbox/`}>checkboxes</a> instead.

<RadioButtonExclusiveChoicesGuideline brand={props.brand} />

### Preselected Option

<RadioButtonGroup brand={props.brand} />

If one of the options is the most common or recommended, pre-select it as the default option. However, ensure it’s easy for the user to change their selection.
