import {LinkButton} from '@financial-times/o3-button';

This technical guide covers Origami "o3", the [latest evolution of Origami](/about/what-is-new/). If you are working with older Origami components, which are still most commonly in use today, we have a separate ["o2" technical guide](/o2-components/technical-guide/).

## User guide

We publish multiple Origami packages to npm which are independently versioned and contain a collection of reusable components and patterns.

If you would like to get started quickly, continue to our [guide to using Origami via npm](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami/tree/main/docs/o3-getting-started.md). Otherwise keep reading for a general technical overview of Origami components.

## Specification

If you would like to contribute to Origami, or better understand how Origami packages are structured, read the [Origami specification](/getting-started/technical-guide/o3-specification).

Among other things, this covers: manifests; naming conventions; package management; documentation; code structure & languages; and browser support.
