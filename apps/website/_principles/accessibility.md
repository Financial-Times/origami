Accessibility is an important aspect of web development at the Financial Times and within Origami. The <abbr title="Financial Times">FT</abbr> website has an AA level <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> accessibility accreditation. This means that we have met certain criteria to make our website more accessible to people with disabilities, according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html" class="o-typography-link--external"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> conformance standards</a>.

Since FT.com uses Origami extensively, it is also our responsibility to uphold the standards of accessibility that the company has been accredited with. In order to do that, we follow a few essential guidelines when building our components.

## Base Guidelines

- We maintain tools and implement processes to help build accessible experiences. Among them are a <a href="https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-colors#demo-contrast-ratio-checker">contrast ratio checker</a> that uses our colour palette, and SASS testing to error if there have been stylistic violations.
- We test our work with screen readers, to assess how well our disabled users interact with our components.
- We use `pa11y`, an <a href="http://pa11y.org/" class="o-typography-link--external"> open source tool</a> that enables us to test the validity and accessibility of our markup.
- We aim to use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G115.html" class="o-typography-link--external">semantic markup</a> where possible. This means that the elements we use in our components reflect their actual meaning.
- We avoid using JavaScript to generate content where possible, and provide text content to describe visual elements in our componentsâ€”we want our work to be machine readable.

The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" class="o-typography-link--external"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0</a> covers all of the details regarding accessibility, including implementation and more detailed guidelines. We recommend you look through these when buildling something new.
