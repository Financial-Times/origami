				Weâ€™re writing JSX templates for our components for the first time, which
				we may make public in the near future. For teams who also use JSX
				templates, this could hugely reduce the complexity of implementing
				Origami components in a project and make our most tricky kind of
				migration (markup changes) simple when upgrading from one major version
				of a component to another.
