				Storybook is still work in progress project but it aims to replace old origami registry
				that is currently used to view demos and documentation for Origami components. The reasoning
				behind choosing Storybook is that it is a well known and widely used tool for documenting and
				making highly interactive UI demos. We wrote about this in our
				<a href="/blog/2021/11/05/newsletter/#storybook">October 2021 newsletter</a>.
