					We are aiming to replace old origami registry that is currently used
					to view demos and documentation for Origami components with new storybook interface. The reasoning
					behind choosing Storybook is that it is a well known and widely used
					tool for documenting and making highly interactive UI demos.
				</p>
				Storybook is still work in progress project and not all components have
				demos. If you don't find the component in storybook, for the moment you
				will need to reference our <a href="/registry">registry</a> instead.

				We wrote more about this in our
				<a href="/blog/2021/11/05/newsletter/#storybook"
					>October 2021 newsletter</a
