The "Create A New Origami Component" tutorial is split into nine parts and is intended to be followed sequentially from start to finish:
1. [Intro & Boilerplate](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-1/)
2. [Base Styles](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-2/)
3. [Themes & Brands](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-3/)
4. [Demos](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-4/)
5. [JavaScript](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-5/)
6. [Storybook](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-storybook/)
7. [Testing](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-6/)
8. [Documentation](/documentation/tutorials/create-a-new-component-part-7/)
9. Component Lifecycle

In part nine we will learn how to publish our component to the Origami registry ðŸŽ‰, and discuss the lifecycle of a published component.

_We don't actually want to publish an example component `o-example`. If you have been following along so far using `o-example`, rather than working on your own component that should actually be published, read this part of the tutorial as a reference only until you're ready to publish a new component for real._

## Source Control

Origami components are store in [Origami monorepo](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami) under components. We will start by commiting the boilerplate as an initial commit. For example:

<pre><code class="o-syntax-highlight--bash">git add --all
git commit -m 'my o-example component'
git push</code></pre>

After pushing your commits you should be able to open a pull request. If you have never open a PR(pull request) you can read more about it on [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

_To be able to opon a PR you will need to be part of [origami collaborators](https://github.com/orgs/Financial-Times/teams/origami-collaborators) team and if you are not a member already ask [#origami-support](https://financialtimes.slack.com/archives/C02FU5ARJ) to help you._
## Initial Release

Lets release the first version our new component. This will display our component in the Origami Registry and send a Slack notification to `{{site.data.contact.slack}}`.

Our first release will be `1.0.0` following the [semver specification](https://semver.org/). Origami components [do not release versions lower than 1.0.0](/specification/v1/components/#component-release) but you may choose to release a beta `1.0.0-beta.1` again following the [semver specification](https://semver.org/).

Before we release, this is a good time to update the components [support status](/specification/v1/manifest/#supportstatus) in `origami.json` according to whether this release of the component will be `experimental` (the component is not ready for production use), or `active` (feature development ongoing, bug reports will be gratefully received and acted upon promptly), etc.

To release an Origami component create a git tag named after the semver version but beginning with a `v` e.g. `v1.0.0`. Create the tag either through the [Github release interface](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) or through the command line:

<pre><code class="o-syntax-highlight--bash">git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0</code></pre>

Within a couple of minutes at most, your component should be visible in the [Origami Registry](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components?module=true&active=true&maintained=true&experimental=true) and should be published to the npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/~the-ft) ðŸŽ‰. If not you may want to confirm that the `npm run test -w components/o-example` and `npm run lint -w components/o-example` commands pass without error, check the output of the Github Actions under the 'Actions" tab, or contact the Origami team for support in the `#{{site.data.contact.slack}}` Slack channel.

## Subsequent Releases

After the first release Origami components may be released automatically by applying one of the Origami labels `release:patch`, `release:minor`, or `release:major` to pull requests (see [Github instructions on applying labels](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests)). When a pull request is merged with a release label a Github Action will create a new [semver](https://semver.org/) git tag according to which label was used. A comment on the pull request will let you know what version number was released.

        This image shows a component pull request which has been merged and released. The `release:patch` label was first added to the pull request. It was then merged. A Github action responded to the release label on merge. It checked the latest release number `v8.1.1` and, as a patch release, calculated the next version should be `v8.1.2`. The Github action then created a new tag `v8.1.2` to release the new version and posted a comment on the pull request.

The [semver specification](https://semver.org/) documents what constitutes a major, minor, or patch release. There are also some [Origami specific considerations](/documentation/components/versioning/#how-components-are-versioned) to keep in mind when versioning a component. For example we may opt to release a major version of a component even with a compatible <abbr title="application programming interface">api</abbr> if it includes drastic visual changes.

## Component Lifecycle

As other teams may depend on Origami components its important to follow the [semver specification](https://semver.org/) when versioning components as discussed previously. It is also important to communicate upcoming changes. The Origami specification includes a section on the [component lifecycle](/specification/v1/components/#component-lifecycle) which includes guidance on how to manage existing components as they mature. The guidance includes how to communicate new releases, the deprecation of component features, and the deprecation of components which are no longer needed.

## Wrapping Up

If you have followed along this far congratulations!

We hope this step-by-step tutorial has helped make you feel more able to contribute to Origami. Both in terms of creating new components, maintaining existing components, and influencing the direction of Origami as a whole.
