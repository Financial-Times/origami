# Brands & Theme Definitions

The following all combine to change the look, feel, and function of a component:

<dl>
  <dt>Brand</dt>
  <dd>A brand applies to an entire product or suite of products. It applies the defining look and feel for the product. E.g "core" (otherwise know as our ft pink brand), "internal" (the ft, but for internal tools and products), the-banker (a specialist title brand).</dd>

  <dt>Sub-Brand</dt>
  <dd>A sub-brand inherits from a brand, but provides a point of differentiation. E.g. "professional" and "ft-live" both belong to the "core" brand, but offer their own distinct look and feel.</dd>

  <dt>Theme</dt>
  <dd>A branded product may make use of multiple themes within a page. E.g. an "inverse" theme may be used to provide emphasis or contrast within a section of a branded product.</dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>A mode affects the entire product, like looking through a lens, to provide an alternate style for brand and theme. E.g. dark mode, high contrast mode.</dd>

  <dt>Platform</dt>
  <dd>Platform variations are made to keep a product consistent but in-keeping with its delivery mechanism, e.g. web, ios, android.</dd>

  <dt>Variant</dt>
  <dd>This is a generic term to refer to a theme, brand, or other differentiator that makes one instance of a component look different to another instance of the same component. E.g. "mono" and "inverse" themes for a button component are variants of the button, a "big" version of the button is also a variant of the button.</dd>
</dl>
