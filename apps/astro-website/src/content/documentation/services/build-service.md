The Origami Build Service is used to bundle component JavaScript and Sass on the fly, allowing a development team to include a `<script>` and `<style>` block in their page to quickly get started with Origami.

This service is freely available to users within the Financial Times. To start using the Build Service, please <a href="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/build">refer to the service documentation</a> or [follow the Build Service tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/build-service/).
