The Origami Bower Registry is decommissioned. Migrate to npm. For details refer to the blog post: [Origami npm announcement and guides on how to migrate products](https://origami.ft.com/blog/2021/07/01/origami-on-npm-and-how-to-migrate/).

The Origami Bower Registry was a custom read-only registry for the <a href="https://bower.io/">Bower package manager</a>. Any public repository on one of the Financial Times' GitHub organisations was published automatically to this registry. This service was freely available to users within the Financial Times.
