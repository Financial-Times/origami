Origami Repo Data is an API which can be used to get information about repositories which contain an `origami.json` file. These could be components, services, image sets, and Node.js modules. Inclusion in this API does not mean a module is supported by the Origami team, and it is mostly for use by members of the Origami team, and requires an API key to use.
