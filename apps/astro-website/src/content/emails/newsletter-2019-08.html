<!-- Thing 1 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Major Component Releases" %}
{% capture text %}
Weâ€™ve been working on upgrades to fundamental Origami components like o-typography, o-colors, and o-buttons. Releasing a new version of these components necessitates a major release of other components too. So weâ€™ve taken the opportunity to introduce recent proposals across all 52 of our components. The upgrades focus on:
<ul>
  <li>Improving our ability to iterate on and share editorial styles across projects.</li>
  <li>Improving our ability to customise Origami for unique products.</li>
  <li>Design consistency.</li>
  <li>Smaller bundle sizes for quicker sites.</li>
  <li>Maintenance and integration efficiency with fewer developer interfaces.</li>
  <li>Removing technical debt.</li>
</ul>
Find out <a target="_blank" href="https://origami.ft.com/blog/2019/10/31/major-cascade/">more about the changes weâ€™re making and why</a> in our blog post.
We will start to release betas for these changes next week, with an announcement and full releases following soon after. Projects which depend on Origami components will need developer input to upgrade. Weâ€™ve discussed our plans with groups across the Financial Times and are planning a time to support Customer Products directly with their more complex upgrade path. If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback please reach out to the team â€” weâ€™re here to help. ðŸ˜Š{% endcapture %}

<!-- Thing 2 -->
{% include email/h3.html content="Origami Fox" %}
{% capture text %}
Also new are our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/financial-times/origami-ci-tools">continuous integration tools for Origami components</a>. They allow us to roll out changes to our build process for all components at once.
With this new found power we made a little Origami Fox friend. Our little Origami Fox tells us if our components are getting bigger or smaller with every change, to help us prevent an unexpected jump which could slow down sites across the Financial Times Group.

The image above shows a message from Fox Friend on an o-comments pull request (a request to make changes to its codebase). The Comments Team have done a great job at reducing the bundle size of o-comments by over 130kb without compression.
If your team maintains an Origami compatible component which doesnâ€™t already use our new Continuous Integration tools let us know, weâ€™re happy to help you start using them.{% endcapture %}

<!-- Thing 3: Not this week. -->

<!-- Special thanks -->
{% include email/h2.html content="Special Thanks" %}

{% capture text %}
Our special thanks this month goes to everyone who has contributed to the design basics working group. Thanks Luke Griffiths, Caroline Nevitt, Mark Limb, Simon Coxon, and Jessica Engerer! They helped rationalise inconsistent design in typography and buttons for the upcoming <a target="_blank" href="https://origami.ft.com/blog/2019/10/31/major-cascade/">major releases</a> discussed above, and have created a Sketch UI Kit of Origami components. Learn more about the new <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/ft-design-basics-1-why-we-finally-built-a-ui-kit-850e98b127bf">UI Kit in Luke Griffithsâ€™ blog post</a>.{% endcapture %}

- MINOR: [o-banner](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-banner) has a new `appendTo` option so imperatively made banners may be inserted into the DOM at a point which is most appropriate for keyboard users.
- MINOR: [o-table](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-table) has a new `updateRows` method to account for new `tr` DOM nodes, this is particularly useful for React integration.
- PATCH: [o-overlay](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-overlay) ensures the overlay CSS is not output multiple times in silent mode is disabled; supports visually hiding the overlay heading declaratively; updates the close button to a semantic `button` element rather than an anchor `a` element.
- PATCH: [o-normalise](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-normalise) fixes a bug with the focus outline colour.
- PATCH: [o-colors](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-colors) adds the focus outline colour, to replace the colour set in o-normalise in a future major.
- MINOR: [o-forms](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-forms) allow the label of box radio buttons to be customised; corrects input labels on date input demos.
- MINOR: [o-header-services](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-header-services) allows mixing drop down navs with non dropdown navs.
- MINOR: [o-header](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-header) improves accessibility across a broader range of screen readers by giving buttons a visually hidden label as well as the existing title attribute.
- MINOR: [ftdomdelegate](https://github.com/Financial-Times/ftdomdelegate) fixes an issue for SVG events in IE and no longer fires events on disabled buttons / inputs.
- PATCH: [o-date](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-date) prevents empty dates being read by assistive technology.
- MINOR: [o-share](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-share) adds link as a valid socialUrl and updates the share icon class names to enable more consistent control over their visibility (credit to Maggie Allen!)
- MINOR: [node-health-check](https://github.com/Financial-Times/node-health-check) sets "ok" if Graphite returns an empty array; switches the memory usage module to one which requires no native dependencies/compiling for Node 12 support (thanks Andreas Hermansson!).

- MINOR: [logo-images](https://github.com/Financial-Times/logo-images) adds logos for use as favicons with notification dot.
