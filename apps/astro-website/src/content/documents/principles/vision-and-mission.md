## Mission

Unifying and documenting the style and experience across the digital products of every FT brand, leveraging the web platform to provide an implementation of the brand guidelines.

## Vision

Every designer and developer in the FT knows how to use Origami, feels they have the agency to contribute to Origami and that they are an owner of Origami.

Origami is the gold standard of design systems and every FT designer and developerâ€™s favourite way to create digital products.
