/**
 * Colour use cases
 *
 * These mappings define what we use our colours for.
 *
 * Use case:           Must be a single word comprising just letters, numbers, and dashes.
 * Properties:         A SASS map of properties (must be 'border', 'text', 'background', or 'all')
 *                     against palette colours (must be an exact match for a name of a colour defined
 *                     in palette.scss).
 *
 * Special properties: You can use the following special properties to mark use cases:
 *
 *                     _deprecated: <msg>  Emits <msg> as a warning if referenced, but still works
