# Migration guide

### Migrating from v7 to v8

Support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service have been removed.

Follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).

## Migrating from v6 to v7

### Updated dependencies

The dependencies for this component have all been updated to the latest major versions.
If you have any conflicts while installing this version, you'll need to first update
its dependencies. See [the Bower config for these](./bower.json).

### Palette Colours

Social palette colours have been renamed:
- `o-share-color-twitter` is now `o-share/twitter`.
- `o-share-color-facebook` is now `o-share/facebook`.
- `o-share-color-linkedin` is now `o-share/linkedin`.
- `o-share-color-pinterest` is now `o-share/pinterest`.
- `o-share-color-whatsapp` is now `o-share/whatsapp`.

```diff
-$color: oColorsGetPaletteColor('o-share-color-twitter');
+$color: oColorsByName('o-share/twitter');
```

### Colour Usecases

The `tooltip` colour usecases have been removed. If used replace with `white` for text and `black-80` for backgrounds, e.g:
```diff
-$color: oColorsGetColorFor('tooltip', background);
+$color: oColorsByName('black-80');
```

The colour usecases for social icons have been renamed:
- `o-share-twitter-color` is now `o-share/twitter-icon`.
- `o-share-facebook-color` is now `o-share/facebook-icon`.
- `o-share-linkedin-color` is now `o-share/linkedin-icon`.
- `o-share-pinterest-color` is now `o-share/pinterest-icon`.
- `o-share-whatsapp-color` is now `o-share/whatsapp-icon`.
- `o-share-mail-color` is now `o-share/ft-icon`.
- `o-share-link-color` is now `o-share/ft-icon`.
- `o-share-share-color` is now `o-share/ft-icon`.

```diff
-border-color: oColorsGetColorFor('o-share-mail-color', 'background');
+border-color: oColorsByUsecase('o-share/ft-icon', 'background');
```

The following usecases have been removed. Please contact the Origami Team if your project requires these:
- `o-share-button-inverse`
- `o-share-button-hover`

### Variables

The variable `$o-share-colors` is now private ans must not be used. Instead use colour usecases, e.g:

```scss
$twitter-color: oColorsByName('facebook', $from: 'o-share')
```

### Mixins

`o-share v7` no longer has public mixins other than the primary mixin `oShare()`. It accepts a map `$opts` that allows you to include only the styles you need. Replace previous calls that used the mixins with one using `oShare` with an optional `$opts` map.

### Google Plus is gone

Google Plus was deprecated during the previous major version. It has now been removed.

### Custom classnames

It's no longer possible to customise the class name used in `o-share`, use the `o-share` classes instead.

## Migrating from v5 to v6

o-share v6 introduces a breaking change that you may need to update in your product:

It may help to look at the [changes made to the demo markup](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-share/pull/100/commits/a7bb5de62d16bd4b4610d80e1c863e32335bf548#diff-bf0fb135efa69a14d71d3a973a919ad5)

- CSS type selectors that were used to apply styles to the `<i>` tag have been removed so an additional class is required.
- We recommended you also use a semantically correct tag instead of the `<i>`.

```diff
<a href="#">
-	<i>
+	<span class="o-share__text">
		Share on Twitter
-	</i>
+	</span>
</a>
```

- CSS type selectors that were used to apply styles to `<a>` and `<button>` tag have been removed so an additional class is required.
- The original class names on `<a>` and `<button>` tags have been removed.

```diff
<a
-class="o-share__action--icon"
+class="o-share__icon o-share__icon--twitter"
href="#">
	<span class="o-share__text">
		Share on Twitter
	</span>
</a>
```

```diff
<button
-class="o-share__action--icon"
+class="o-share__icon o-share__icon--mail"
>
	<span class="o-share__text">
		Share via Email
	</span>
</button>
```
- The BEM modifier used to vary the social platform type has been removed from the element with the `o-share__action` class.

```diff
<li class="o-share__action
-o-share__action--twitter
">
	<a class="o-share__icon o-share__icon--twitter" href="#">
    	<span class="o-share__text">
        	Share on Twitter
    	</span>
	</a>
</li>
```

## Migrating from v4 to v5

o-share v5 introduces a breaking change that you may need to update in your product:

- buttons and anchor elements require an extra class (`o-share__action--icon`) to avoid specificity issues with other components that use `o-icons`
```diff
<a
+class="o-share__action--icon"
href="#"><i>Icon</i></a>
<button
+class="o-share__action--icon"
><i>Icon</i></button>
```

## Migrating from v3 to v4

o-share v4 introduces a few breaking changes that you may need to update in your product:

  - V4 introduces the new major version of `o-colors`. Updating to this new version will mean updating any other components that you have which are using `o-colors`
  - the link share option has been removed

## Migrating from v2 to v3

o-share v3 introduces a few breaking changes that you may need to update in your product:


  - button size has increased from 36px to 40px which might effect the surrounding elements of your design
  - the Reddit share option has been removed
  - the URL share option has been renamed from `o-share__action--url` to `o-share__action--link`
