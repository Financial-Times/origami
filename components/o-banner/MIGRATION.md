# Migration guide

## Migrating from v3 to v4

Support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service have been removed.

Follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).

## Migrating from v2 to v3

### Updated dependencies

The dependencies for this component have all been updated to the latest major versions.
If you have any conflicts while installing this version, you'll need to first update
its dependencies. See [the Bower config for these](./bower.json).

### JavaScript

Custom classes have been removed, so you'll need to update your code to use the documented `o-banner` classes if you were setting any of these in `options`:

```
bannerClass,
bannerClosedClass,
outerClass,
innerClass,
contentClass,
contentLongClass,
contentShortClass,
actionsClass,
actionClass,
actionSecondaryClass,
buttonClass,
linkClass,
closeButtonClass,
```

In addition `theme` no longer accepts an array. Instead pass a single `theme` ('marketing', 'product') and a `layout` ('small', 'compact').

```diff
-const myBanner = new oBanner({
-    theme: ['small', 'marketing']
-});
+const myBanner = new oBanner({
+    theme: 'marketing',
+    layout: 'small'
+});
```

### Sass

The main sass mixin, `oBanner`, no longer takes a custom class as an argument. Themes have been split into layouts ('small', 'compact') and themes ('marketing', 'product'). These are passed as part of the `$opts` map, as so:

```scss
@include oBanner($opts: (
	'themes': ('small'),
	'layouts': ('compact'),
))
```

The `themes` option used to take a map or the word 'all', but as 'all' is the default, one can get that effect by not specifying anything.

```scss
@include oBanner()
```

All other mixins have been removed, you'll need to update your code to use the documented `o-banner` classes.

#### Colour Usecases

The following colour usecases have been removed. Please contact the Origami team if your project relied on these:
- o-banner
- o-banner-button
- o-banner-button-active
- o-banner-link
- o-banner-close
- o-banner-heading-rule
- o-banner-marketing
- o-banner-marketing-button
- o-banner-marketing-button-active
- o-banner-marketing-link
- o-banner-marketing-close
- o-banner-marketing-heading-rule
- o-banner-product
- o-banner-product-button
- o-banner-product-button-active
- o-banner-product-link
- o-banner-product-close
- o-banner-product-heading-rule


## Migrating from v1 to v2

V2 of o-banner removes and renames several themes. This includes the removal of associated mixins and variables. The removed themes are `marketing-primary` and `marketing-secondary`. This should be replaced with `marketing`. E.g. the following classes should change:

```diff
- <div class="o-banner o-banner--small o-banner--marketing-primary" …
+ <div class="o-banner o-banner--small o-banner--marketing" …
  …
```

```diff
- <div class="o-banner o-banner--small o-banner--marketing-secondary" …
+ <div class="o-banner o-banner--small o-banner--marketing" …
  …
```

As well as this, the default teal theme has been replaced with a white theme. The old default teal theme is now named `product`. E.g. to get the teal banner back:

```diff
- <div class="o-banner" …
+ <div class="o-banner o-banner--product" …
  …
```
