## Migration Guide

### Migrating from v1 to v2

This major release introduces a new design language and visually breaking changes. This includes mobile optimised typography, icons, and buttons. It also removes peer dependencies from deprecated "o2" components.

To upgrade, replace the following "o2" components with their "o3" equivalent:

- [o-normalise](../o-normalise/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-spacing](../o-spacing/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-colors](../o-colors/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-icons](../o-icons/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-buttons](../o-buttons/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-typography](../o-typography/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-editorial-typography](../o-editorial-typography/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-big-number](../o-big-number/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-quote](../o-quote/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-fonts](../o-fonts/MIGRATION.md)
