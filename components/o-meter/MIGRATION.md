# Migration Guide

## Migrating from v3 to v4

This major release introduces a new design language and visually breaking changes. This includes mobile optimised typography, icons, and buttons. It also removes peer dependencies from deprecated "o2" components.

To upgrade, replace the following "o2" components with their "o3" equivalent:

- [o-normalise](../o-normalise/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-spacing](../o-spacing/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-colors](../o-colors/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-icons](../o-icons/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-buttons](../o-buttons/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-typography](../o-typography/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-editorial-typography](../o-editorial-typography/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-big-number](../o-big-number/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-quote](../o-quote/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-fonts](../o-fonts/MIGRATION.md)

## Migrating from v2 to v3

Support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service have been removed.

## Migrating from v1 to v2

If your project uses a meter of a custom colour, rename the CSS variables:

- `--o-meter-high-color` to `--o-meter-sub-optimum-color`
- `--o-meter-low-color` to `--o-meter-less-than-sub-optimum-color`
