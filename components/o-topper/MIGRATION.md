# Migration guide

## Migrating from v6 to v7

This major release introduces a new design language and visually breaking changes. This includes mobile optimised typography, icons, and buttons. It also removes peer dependencies from deprecated "o2" components.

To upgrade, replace the following "o2" components with their "o3" equivalent:

- [o-normalise](../o-normalise/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-spacing](../o-spacing/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-colors](../o-colors/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-icons](../o-icons/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-buttons](../o-buttons/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-typography](../o-typography/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-editorial-typography](../o-editorial-typography/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-big-number](../o-big-number/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-quote](../o-quote/MIGRATION.md)
- [o-fonts](../o-fonts/MIGRATION.md)

## Migrating from v5 to v6

`o-topper` no longer includes JavaScript to select the correct topper for JSON-formatted FT articles and flags. This helper was deeply tied to the FT.com content store, and included hardcoded UUIDs and business logic beyond the scope of Origami. Origami components focus on providing reusable user interfaces â€“ without business logic assumptions which could limit their use outside specific groups or use-cases.

To migrate, replace `o-topper` JavaScript with [`n-map-content-to-topper`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-map-content-to-topper).

```diff
-import { mapContentToTopper } from '@financial-times/o-topper';
+import mapContentToTopper from '@financial-times/n-map-content-to-topper';
const topper = mapContentToTopper(ftArticle, flags);
```

## Migrating from v4 to v5

The velvet topper (previously used to indicate life and arts) has been removed.

- Confirm the `.o-topper--color-velvet` class is not used - [it appears the velvet topper style is no longer used by projects](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-topper/pull/94) - consult Origami and the design team to remove its use if it is.
- If your project uses the `oTopper` Sass mixin with an options argument and `colors` key, remove `velvet` as a value.

```diff
@include oTopper($opts: (
	'themes': (
        //...
	),
	'elements': (
        //...
	),
	'colors': (
        //...
		'sky',
-		'velvet'
	)
));
```

## Migrating from v3 to v4

Support for Bower and version 2 of the Origami Build Service have been removed.

Follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/documentation/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).

## Migrating from v2 to v3

The `oTopper` mixin now outputs all o-topper styles by default. Pass a blank options `$opts` map to only output base topper styles.

All other mixins have been removed. Instead make a single `oTopper`, with relevant options, and use default `o-topper` css classes.

- `oTopperThemeBranded`
- `oTopperHasHeadshot`
- `oTopperThemeOpinion`
- `oTopperOpinionGenre`
- `oTopperHeadshot`
- `oTopperHeadshotImage`
- `oTopperThemeCentered`
- `oTopperThemeFullBleedImage`
- `oTopperThemeFullBleedOffset`
- `oTopperThemeNewsPackage`
- `oTopperAnchorLink`
- `oTopperThemePackage`
- `oTopperThemePackageExtra`
- `oTopperThemePackageSpecialReport`
- `oTopperGridRightRail`
- `oTopperFullBleedGridRightRail`
- `oTopperThemeSplitText`
- `oTopperHeadline`
- `oTopperHeadlineLarge`
- `oTopperStandfirst`
- `oTopperSummary`
- `oTopperSummaryBody`
- `oTopperImageCredit`
- `oTopperImage`
- `oTopperBrand`
- `oTopperColumnist`
- `oTopperColumnistName`
- `oTopperTags`
- `oTopperTopic`

- `oTopperVisual`
- `oTopperReadNext`
- `oTopperThemeElements`
- `oTopperThemes`
- `oTopperElements`

E.g to include all styles:

```diff
-$o-topper-is-silent: false;
-@import 'o-topper/main';
-@include _oTopperThemes;
+@import 'o-topper/main';
+@include _oTopper();
```

E.g to include only base styles and some themes:

```diff
-.o-topper--branded {
-	@include _oTopperThemeBranded;
-	&.o-topper--right-rail {
-		@include _oTopperGridRightRail;
-	}
-}
+@include _oTopper($opts: (

+));
```
