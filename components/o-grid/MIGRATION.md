## Migration Guide

### Migrating from v5 to v6

V6 has dropped support for use through Bower.

If you were already using npm, no changes should be required.

If you have been using Bower or the Origami Build Service, follow [the migration guide on the Origami website](https://origami.ft.com/docs/tutorials/bower-to-npm/).

### Migrating from v4 to v5

### Sass

IE8 is no longer supported, remove uses of:
- `$o-grid-ie8-rules`
- `oGridTargetIE8`
- `oGridTargetModernBrowsers`

The following Sass mixins and variables have been removed. Replace them with a single call to `oGrid` with the relevant options. See [the README](./README.md) for more details:
- `oGridGenerate`
- `$o-grid-shuffle-selectors`
- `$o-grid-human-friendly-selectors`

```diff
-$o-grid-human-friendly-selectors: true;
-$o-grid-shuffle-selectors: true;
-@include oGridGenerate();
+@include oGrid($opts: (
+	'bleed': true,
+	'shuffle-selectors': true,
+	'friendly-selectors': true,
+	'rows': ('compact')
+));
```

The variable `$o-grid-debug-mode` has also been removed. Include the mixin `oGridDebugInfo` to output debug styles instead.

### JavaScript

- As IE8 is no longer supported and the method `setMinSupportedIeVersion` has been removed.

### Migrating from v3 to v4

#### Important Changes

- Layout sizes have slightly changed (M, L and XL are 10px wider).
- Gutter widths vary between layouts (default: 10px, M and above: 20px)

#### Markup/Sass changes

- Wrap top-level `<div class="o-grid-row">` into `<div class="o-grid-container">`.
- Search `oGridColumn` and replace with `oGridColspan`.
- The mixin `oGridColspan` from v3 outputs a bit more code. Use `oGridColspan($span, $width-only: true)` to only outputs widths. Note that with gzip this should not have any impact.
- `$o-grid-gutter` becomes `$o-grid-gutters` (plural) and now contains a map
- Change all `$o-grid-gutter` to `oGridGutter()`. e.g. `margin-left: $o-grid-gutter` becomes `margin-left: oGridGutter()`
- A few helpers have been removed because they weren't used.
