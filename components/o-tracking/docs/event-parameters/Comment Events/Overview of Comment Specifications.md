This tracking specification is not designed to be a comprehensive list of events and key-value pairs, rather it is ensure that the events are tracked to meet the business's requirements, from an informational, accessibility and consistency perspectives
- If an event / key-value pair is not specified in this specification it does not necessarily mean it should not be implemented
Any event / key-value pair that is not specified but still required for the underlying functionality of the NGDA tables should still be implemented
