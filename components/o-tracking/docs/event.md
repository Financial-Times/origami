# Event

## Spec

`category`, `action` and `system` are MANDATORY, everything else is OPTIONAL

This allows a low barrier to entry for anyone wanting to submit events to Spoor.

__Important__: To decide how to name the category and action fields, consider this sentence (square brackets denote that part is optional):

*A user can {action} a {category}\[ with/having a {context}\[ to {destination}]]*

For example:
* A user can view a page having a uuid.
* A user can play a video having a video ID.
* A user can share a comment having a comment ID to Facebook.
* A user can share an article having a uuid to email.
* A user can scroll a page with a asset type.
* A user can open an email.
* A user can click an element.

```js
{
    category: 'video',
    action: 'play',
    ... any other key-values ...
    id: '512346789',
    pos: '10'
}
```

## Notes

- If certain properties are not present in the payload they will be appended via Spoor enrichment.
- It's for use by server and client-side systems sending events to Spoor.
- It is intentionally abstracted away from any particular database format and meant to represent a logical, easy to understand data structure.
- It assumes the consumers of the event stream can manipulate the data in to their desired storage format.
- It doesn't assume users of the data will need to join the data across tables to find the information they want.


## References
1. The general convention might be something like `product.sub-system.environment` - Eg, 'webapp.render.uat'
2. Or in absence appended by Spoor.
3. Spoor will scan any Cookies in the header for a FTSession token as well.
4. Content will typically be a page, but could be a uuid for something else like a video. Will be expanded in to a CAPI v2 object -> capi: { "headline", "...", "published": "...", ... }
5. Expanded in to a URL object using the [NodeJS URL API](http://nodejs.org/api/url.html)
6. Spoor will also allow this in a `authorization` header.
7. Enum of `account, ad, blog, front, image, page, report, search, section, story, topic, video` ([see spoor-enrichment issue 94](https://github.com/Financial-Times/spoor-enrichment/issues/94])).
